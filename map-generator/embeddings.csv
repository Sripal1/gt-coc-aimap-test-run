Abrahim Ladha,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f_7ev68AAAAJ&hl=en,f_7ev68AAAAJ,"Lecturer, Georgia Tech",8,Research areas not specified,https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~ladha/,"Simple but mission-critical internet-based applications that require extremely high reliability, availability, and verifiability (e.g., auditability) could benefit from running on robust public programmable blockchain platforms such as Ethereum. Unfortunately, program code running on such blockchains is normally publicly viewable, rendering these platforms unsuitable for applications requiring strict privacy of application code, data, and results.In this work, we investigate using MPC techniques to protect the privacy of a blockchain computation. While our main goal is to hide both the data and the computed function itself, we also consider the standard MPC setting where the function is public.We describe GABLE (Garbled Autonomous Bots Leveraging Ethereum), a blockchain MPC architecture and system. The GABLE architecture specifies the roles and capabilities of the players. GABLE includes two approaches for …","Cryptography, Blockchain Technology, Secure Computation, Game Theory, Distributed Systems, Privacy-Preserving Technologies, Smart Contracts, Theoretical Computer Science, Software Engineering, Formal Methods","## Overview\n\n**Abrahim Ladha** is currently a *Lecturer* in the **College of Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

Unfortunately, virtualization also prevents efficient access to accelerators, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), that have become critical components in the design and architecture of HPC systems. Supporting General Purpose computing on GPUs (GPGPU) with accelerators from different vendors presents significant challenges due to proprietary programming models, heterogeneity, and the need to share accelerator resources between different Virtual Machines (VMs). To address this problem, this paper presents GViM, a system designed for virtualizing and managing the resources of a general purpose system accelerated by graphics processors. Using the NVIDIA GPU as an example, we discuss how such accelerators can be virtualized without …","Virtualization, Data Center Management, Non-Volatile Memory Systems, High-Performance Computing, Edge Computing, Autonomic Computing, Operating Systems Design, Computer Architecture, Network Function Virtualization, Cybersecurity","## Overview\n\n**Ada Gavrilovska** is a *Professor* in the **School of Computer Science** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

METHOD A prospective longitudinal design was used to compare 25 infants later diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with 25 gender-matched low-risk children later determined to have typical development. Participants were evaluated at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months of age. Frequencies of gaze to faces, social smiles, and directed vocalizations were coded from video and rated by examiners. RESULTS The frequency of gaze to faces, shared smiles, and vocalizations to others were highly comparable between groups at 6 months of age, but significantly declining trajectories over time were apparent in the group later diagnosed with ASD. Group differences were significant by 12 months of age on most variables.

The majority of research in the context of wireless-based localization systems has focused on device-based active localization, in which devices are attached to tracked entities. Recently, device-free passive localization (DfP) has been proposed where the tracked entity is neither required to carry devices nor to participate actively in the localization process. Previous studies have focused on small areas and/or controlled environments. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and analysis of Nuzzer, a large-scale DfP localization system, which tracks entities in real environments, rich in multipath. We first present probabilistic techniques for DfP localization of a single entity and evaluate their performance both analytically and in typical office buildings. Our results show that …","Computer Networks, Mobile Computing, Systems, Wireless Networking, Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Network Performance Analysis, Resource Allocation, Distributed Systems, Machine Learning (for systems/networking applications)","## Overview\n\n**Ahmed Saeed** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Computer Science** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

This study aims to conduct before-and-after sentiment analysis to examine how these two fatal crashes have affected people's perceptions of self-driving and autonomous vehicle technology using Twitter data. Five different and relevant keywords were used to extract tweets. Over 1.7 million tweets were found within 15 days before and after the incidents with the specific keywords, which were eventually analyzed in this study. The results indicate that after the two incidents, the negative tweets on “self-driving/autonomous” technology increased by 32 percentage points (from 14% to 46%). The compound scores of “pedestrian crash”, “Uber”, and “Tesla” keywords saw a 6% decrease while “self-driving …","Social Media Analytics, Natural Disaster Detection and Management, Big Data Processing and Analytics, Computer Vision and Image Analysis, Information Retrieval and Text Mining, Public Perception and Sentiment Analysis, Computational Social Science, Machine Learning for Event Detection, Distributed Systems and Services Computing, Multilingual Natural Language Processing","## Overview\n\n**Aibek Musaev** is currently a *Lecturer* in the **College of Computing's Division of Computing Instruction** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

The performance of standard NLP tools is severely degraded on tweets. This paper addresses this issue by re-building the NLP pipeline beginning with part-of-speech tagging, through chunking, to named-entity recognition. Our novel T-NER system doubles F1 score compared with the Stanford NER system. T-NER leverages the redundancy inherent in tweets to achieve this performance, using LabeledLDA to exploit Freebase dictionaries as a source of distant supervision. LabeledLDA outperforms cotraining, increasing F1 by 25% over ten common entity types.","Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Information Extraction, Deep Learning, Dialogue Systems, Sentiment Analysis, Text Mining, Social Media Analysis, Computational Linguistics","## Overview\n\n**Alan Ritter** is currently an *Associate Professor* in the **School of Interactive Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*, with an additional affiliation with the **Machine Learning Center**. His primary research focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, where his group investigates the development of <u>robust models that function effectively across diverse domains and languages</u>, while also prioritizing efficiency in computational resources and minimizing the need for extensive labeled data. Dr. Ritter also explores the creation of <u>data-driven dialogue agents capable of safe and natural conversations</u> across a wide array of topics.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Ritter specializes in a broad spectrum of research areas within artificial intelligence and computational linguistics, including **Natural Language Processing**, **Machine Learning**, **Artificial Intelligence**, **Information Extraction**, and **Deep Learning**. His expertise further extends to <u>Dialogue Systems, Sentiment Analysis, Text Mining, Social Media Analysis, and Computational Linguistics</u>. A significant portion of his work focuses on improving the robustness and adaptability of NLP tools, particularly for noisy, user-generated text, and developing methods for <u>context-aware and culturally nuanced language models</u>.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Ritter has made significant contributions to the development of **robust information extraction systems** for challenging text genres, particularly social media. His work includes pioneering **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** in tweets, dramatically improving performance over traditional NLP tools, and extracting critical information such as <u>cybersecurity events and major life occurrences</u> from noisy online data.\n*   He has also advanced the field of **dialogue generation** through the application of deep reinforcement learning and adversarial training. This research aims to create conversational agents that can produce <u>more coherent, engaging, and human-like responses</u>, addressing limitations of earlier models that tended to generate generic replies.\n*   His recent efforts include leading the **AI-Caring project**, which focuses on developing <u>safe and helpful dialogue assistants for older adults</u>. These instruction-grounded chatbots aim to support independent living by assisting with daily activities, while also investigating and mitigating the risks of inappropriate or offensive language generation in large language models.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Ritter earned his **Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering** from the *University of Washington*. He further honed his research expertise as a **postdoctoral fellow** in the *Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University*. Prior to joining *Georgia Tech*, he served as an *Assistant Professor* in the **Department of Computer Systems and Electrical Engineering** at *The Ohio State University*.\n\nHis academic achievements are recognized through numerous accolades, including an **NSF CAREER Award**, an **Amazon Research Award**, a **Sony Faculty Innovation Award**, and several paper awards from the *Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics*. Dr. Ritter is highly active in the academic community, evidenced by his role as **Program Chair for NAACL 2025** and frequent appointments as an <u>Area Chair for prestigious conferences</u> such as

Over the past 10 years the research community and the networking industry have investigated, proposed and developed several classification approaches. While traffic classification techniques are improving in accuracy and efficiency, the continued proliferation of different Internet application behaviors, in addition to growing incentives to disguise some applications to avoid filtering or blocking, are among the reasons that traffic classification remains one of many open problems in Internet research. In this article we review recent achievements and discuss future directions in traffic classification, along with their trade-offs in applicability, reliability, and privacy.

Proctoring is one way of accomplishing this, and with the increasing popularity of online courses—along with the sudden shift to online education sparked by the COVID‐19 pandemic—digital proctoring has seen an increase in use. However, there are privacy and bias concerns related to digital proctoring, so it is important to critically examine its role in higher education—when it should and should not be used, and how it is perceived among those who interact with it. Objectives In this paper, we: examine the features of and concerns about digital proctoring; analyse the results of a survey regarding student and teaching assistant (TA) attitudes towards digital proctoring; and present alternatives to digital proctoring and a framework for evaluating the need for a digital …","Educational Technology, Online Learning, Computer Science Education, Higher Education, Student Experience, Distance Education, Educational Psychology, Data Privacy (GDPR), Research Methodology, Human-Computer Interaction","## Overview\n\n**Alex Duncan** is currently the *Senior Director* of the **Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

The note attached to the side of the monitor, the papers spread out on the desk, diagrams scrawled on a whiteboard, and even the keys left out on the counter are all examples of using space to recall, reveal relationships, and think. Technological advances have made it possible to construct large display environments in which space has real meaning. This paper examines how increased space affects the way displays are regarded and used within the context of the cognitively demanding task of sensemaking. A pair of studies were conducted demonstrating how the spatial environment supports sensemaking by becoming part of the distributed cognitive process, providing both external memory and a semantic layer.","Information Visualization, Visual Analytics, Human-Computer Interaction, Data Science, Machine Learning, User Experience Research, Cognitive Science, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining","## Overview\n\n**Alex Endert** is currently an *Associate Professor* and the *Associate Chair of Operations and Special Initiatives* in the **School of Interactive Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

Alexander Adams,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=assJWZYAAAAJ&hl=en,assJWZYAAAAJ,Georgia Institute of Technology,1141,Ubiquitous Computing,https://www.alexandertadams.com/,"In this paper, we propose BodyBeat, a novel mobile sensing system for capturing and recognizing a diverse range of non-speech body sounds in real-life scenarios. Non-speech body sounds, such as sounds of food intake, breath, laughter, and cough contain invaluable information about our dietary behavior, respiratory physiology, and affect. The BodyBeat mobile sensing system consists of a custom-built piezoelectric microphone and a distributed computational framework that utilizes an ARM microcontroller and an Android smartphone. The custom-built microphone is designed to capture subtle body vibrations directly from the body surface without being perturbed by external sounds. The microphone is attached to a 3D printed neckpiece with a suspension mechanism. The ARM embedded system and the Android smartphone process the acoustic signal from the microphone and identify non-speech body sounds. We have extensively evaluated the BodyBeat mobile sensing system. Our results show that BodyBeat outperforms other existing solutions in capturing and recognizing different types of important non-speech body sounds.","Human-Computer Interaction, Pervasive Computing, Wearable Computing, Affective Computing, Mobile Sensing, Health Informatics, Biomedical Engineering, Ubiquitous Sensing, Behavioral Interventions, Signal Processing","## Overview\n\n**Alexander T.

His lab, the Uncommon Sense Labs, also emphasizes **3D printing, machine learning, computer vision, embedded systems, and optical design** for end-to-end development of sensing solutions.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Adams developed **BodyBeat**, a mobile sensing system capable of capturing and recognizing diverse non-speech body sounds, such as those related to food intake, breath, laughter, and cough, to provide invaluable insights into dietary behavior, respiratory physiology, and emotional states. This system utilizes a custom-built piezoelectric microphone and a distributed computational framework to accurately identify subtle body sounds.\n*   He is also recognized for **DoppleSleep**, a contactless and unobtrusive sleep sensing system that uses commercial off-the-shelf Doppler radar modules to continuously track sleep quality. This innovation integrates vital signs and body movement sensing to monitor coarse body movements as well as subtle chest and heart movements from breathing and heartbeat.\n*   Additionally, Dr. Adams led the creation of **EmotionCheck**, a wearable device designed to help individuals regulate their emotions, particularly anxiety, by providing *false feedback of a slow heart rate* through subtle wrist vibrations. This work leverages the psychological principle that our perception of bodily signals directly influences our feelings. More recently, he has contributed to **OptoBeat**, an *equity-driven smartphone-based optical sensing system* for measuring skin tone–calibrated peripheral blood oxygen saturation, which addresses existing disparities in traditional pulse oximeters.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Adams completed his **Bachelor of Science** at the *University of North Carolina at Charlotte* in 2014. He then earned his **Ph.D. at Cornell University in 2021**, where he was advised by *Professor Tanzeem Choudhury* in the **People Aware Computing (PAC) lab**. During his doctoral studies, he gained practical experience through internships at *Nokia Research, Samsung Research, and Microsoft Research NeXT*. Prior to joining Georgia Tech in Fall 2022, he served as a **resident Research Scientist** for the *Precision Behavioral Health Initiative at Cornell Tech (NYC)*.

Our constructions are based on the recently proposed GDH signature scheme of Boneh et al. . Due to the instrumental structure of GDH groups and of the base scheme, it turns out that most of our constructions are simpler, more efficient and have more useful properties than similar existing constructions. We support all the proposed schemes with proofs under the appropriate computational assumptions, using the corresponding notions of security.","Applied Cryptography, Public-Key Cryptography, Symmetric Encryption, Digital Signatures, Cryptographic Protocols, Network Security, Database Security, Privacy-Preserving Technologies, Security Proofs, Information Theory","## Overview\n\n**Alexandra Boldyreva** is a distinguished *Professor* with joint appointments in the **School of Cybersecurity and Privacy** and the **School of Computer Science** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

The large number of servers needed to accommodate this massive memory footprint requires frequent server-to-server communication in applications such as key-value stores and graph-based applications that rely on large irregular data structures. The fine-grained nature of the accesses is a poor match to commodity networking technologies, including RDMA, which incur delays of 10-1000x over local DRAM operations. We introduce Scale-Out NUMA (soNUMA) -- an architecture, programming model, and communication protocol for low-latency, distributed in-memory processing. soNUMA layers an RDMA-inspired programming model directly on top of a NUMA memory fabric via a stateless messaging protocol.

These applications impose new and demanding systems requirements, both in terms of performance and flexibility. In this paper, we consider these requirements and present Ray—a distributed system to address them. Ray implements a unified interface that can express both task-parallel and actor-based computations, supported by a single dynamic execution engine. To meet the performance requirements, Ray employs a distributed scheduler and a distributed and fault-tolerant store to manage the system’s control state. In our experiments, we demonstrate scaling beyond 1.8 million tasks per second and better performance than existing specialized systems for several challenging reinforcement learning applications.","Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning Systems, Large Language Model Inference, Real-time Systems, Resource Management, Cluster Scheduling, Performance Optimization, Hardware-Software Co-design, Serverless Computing","## Overview\n\n**Alexey Tumanov** is currently a *tenured Associate Professor* in the **School of Computer Science** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*, where he directs the **Systems for Artificial Intelligence Lab (SAIL)**.

These efforts collectively address critical challenges in optimizing <u>LLM serving performance</u>, focusing on enhancing throughput-latency trade-offs, developing large-scale simulation frameworks for LLM inference, and devising parallelization strategies for efficiently serving multi-million context length inference requests without approximations.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Tumanov earned his **Ph.D. in Computer Science** from *Carnegie Mellon University* in 2016, where his doctoral research developed a theoretical framework for declarative spatio-temporal resource allocation. Following his Ph.D., he completed a **Postdoctoral Fellowship** at *UC Berkeley's RiseLab*, contributing significantly to the design and development of successful open-source platforms like Ray and Ray Serve. Prior to his Ph.D., he conducted research on agile stateful VM replication at the *University of Toronto* and worked in industry on cluster middleware for distributed datacenter resource management.\n\nHis significant academic recognition includes the prestigious **NSERC Alexander Graham Bell Canada Graduate Scholarship**, an **ISTC-CC Fellowship**, and support from the **Parallel Data Lab Consortium**. He is also a recipient of the *Best Student Paper Award* for his dissertation work published at EuroSys 2016, the *Test of Time Award* at the ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing (SoCC'21), and has been honored with Georgia Tech's **College of Computing Outstanding Junior Faculty Teaching Award** (2024) and **Junior Faculty Research Award** (2025).",5.9441314,2.983198,"[-0.48284462094306946,

Drawing on two years of ethnographic fieldwork, we consider how democratic caring might be enacted and sustained through collaborative data work. We employ philosopher Joan Tronto's theory of caring democracy to structure our analysis of a resident-led initiative that uses data to organize and address issues of neglect and abandonment in their neighborhood. Adding to the CSCW literature on sociotechnical systems of care, we look particularly at Tronto's concept of caring democracy where caring needs and the ways in which they are met are an ongoing and inclusive process of assigning and reassigning caring responsibilities, characterized by both equality of voice and freedom from domination. This work develops grounded insight into the practice of …","Critical Data Studies, Science and Technology Studies (STS), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Digital Democracy, Data Ethics, Social Computing, Community Organizing, Participatory Design, Information Ethics, Qualitative Research Methods","## Overview\n\n**Amanda Meng** is currently a *Research Faculty member* in the **College of Computing**, specifically within the *School of Computer Science*, at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**.

Psychologists can observe new or rare phenomena online and can do research on traditional psychological topics more efficiently, enabling them to expand the scale and scope of their research. Yet these opportunities entail risk both to research quality and to human subjects. Internet research is inherently no more risky than traditional observational, survey, or experimental methods. Yet the risks and safeguards against them will differ from those characterizing traditional research and will themselves change over time. This article describes some benefits and challenges of conducting psychological research via the Internet and offers recommendations to both researchers and institutional review boards for dealing with them.","Human-Computer Interaction, Social Computing, Computer-Mediated Communication, Online Communities, Collaborative Systems, Digital Ethics, Information Science, Educational Technology, Digital Sociology, Qualitative Research Methods","## Overview\n\n**Amy Susan Bruckman** is a *Regents' Professor* and **Senior Associate Chair** in the **School of Interactive Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*. Her primary research interests lie in <u>social computing</u>, with a strong focus on online collaboration, understanding across differences, and content moderation. She also investigates internet research ethics, a field in which she has made foundational contributions. Bruckman's work often explores how the design features of online environments shape human behavior and facilitate collaborative knowledge construction.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Bruckman specializes in a broad range of research areas, including **Social Computing**, **Collaborative Computing**, and **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**. Her expertise extends to *Computer-Mediated Communication*, *Online Communities*, and *Collaborative Systems*, where she examines the dynamics of digital interaction. She also delves into **Digital Ethics** and *Information Science*, particularly concerning the ethical conduct of online research and content governance. Historically, her work has included **Educational Technology**, *Digital Sociology*, *Qualitative Research Methods*, and the *Learning Sciences*, with a focus on constructionist learning and the social aspects of online learning environments.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Bruckman pioneered the development of early virtual communities and constructionist learning environments, such as **MediaMOO** and **MOOSE Crossing**. These influential projects provided spaces for professional community building and enabled children to learn computer programming and literacy through collaborative, project-based activities, demonstrating the educational potential of online interaction.\n*   She has made significant contributions to the field of **Internet research ethics**, developing ethical guidelines and empirically studying participant reactions to being studied online. This work has been crucial in establishing responsible research practices for human subjects in digital environments, addressing complex issues of privacy and informed consent.\n*   Her extensive research on **online collaboration and content moderation** has profoundly shaped our understanding of large-scale cooperative systems like Wikipedia. Her studies have explored the transformation of participation, governance, and decentralization in online encyclopedias, and more recently, the impact of content removal, deplatforming, and human-machine collaboration in moderation on platforms like Reddit and Twitter. This culminated in her 2022 book, ""Should You Believe Wikipedia? Online Communities and the Construction of Knowledge,"" which critically examines how knowledge is built in digital spaces.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Bruckman's academic journey began with a **Bachelor of Arts degree in Physics** from *Harvard University* in 1987. She then earned both her **Master's degree** (1991) from the *Interactive Cinema Group* and her **Ph.D.** (1997) from the *Epistemology and Learning Group* at the *MIT Media Lab*. Upon graduating, she joined the *Georgia Institute of Technology* as an Assistant Professor in 1997, where she later became a tenured Associate Professor in 2003 and a Full Professor in 2012, eventually achieving the prestigious title of Regents' Professor.\n\nA recipient of numerous accolades, Dr. Bruckman was named one of *MIT Technology Review's TR100* innovators under 35 in 1999 and received the *Jan Hawkins Award* for Early Career Contributions to Humanistic Research and Scholarship in Learning Technologies in 2002. In 2018, she was recognized as an **ACM Fellow** for her contributions to collaborative computing and foundational work in internet research ethics, and she is also a member of the *ACM SIGCHI Academy*. She has held leadership roles, including General Co-chair of the ACM CSCW conference and Chair of its Steering Committee. Dr. Bruckman also founded Georgia Tech's **Electronic Learning Communities (ELC) Lab** and the **Undergraduate Research Opportunities in Computing (UROC) program**, fostering student engagement in research.",12.94096,4.457866,"[-0.2597411274909973, 0.05438907444477081, 0.18044614791870117, -0.2353476583957672, 0.24262799322605133, 0.0784779042005539, 0.2089632898569107, 0.3976474106311798,

However, the risks remain under-explored. To address the gap, this work first examined characteristics of AI-generated misinformation (AI-misinfo) compared with human creations, and then evaluated the applicability of existing solutions. We compiled human-created COVID-19 misinformation and abstracted it into narrative prompts for a language model to output AI-misinfo. We found significant linguistic differences within human-AI pairs, and patterns of AI-misinfo in enhancing details, communicating uncertainties, drawing conclusions, and simulating personal tones. While existing models remained capable of classifying AI-misinfo, a significant performance drop compared to human-misinfo was observed. Results suggested that existing information assessment guidelines had …","Human-Computer Interaction, Digital Health, Health Equity, Health Disparities, Social Computing, Health Informatics, HCI for Social Good, Participatory Design, Crisis Informatics, Health Promotion Technology","## Overview\n\n**Andrea G.

Her expertise also extends to *Health Disparities, Health Informatics, HCI for Social Good, Participatory Design, Crisis Informatics,* and *Health Promotion Technology*. A significant aspect of her research involves taking an <u>ecological approach to technology design</u>, conducting in-depth fieldwork to understand how intrapersonal, social, cultural, and environmental factors influence wellbeing and how technology can help communities overcome health barriers. Her current projects include equity-focused research in **Black women's maternal and mental health**, youth civic engagement, COVID health information practices and visualization, and faith-based health interventions.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Parker has made significant contributions to designing and evaluating <u>mobile health (mHealth) interventions for vulnerable populations</u>. Her projects have developed tools and systems to promote healthy behaviors, such as nutritious eating and physical activity, within low-income communities, helping to address disproportionate diet-related problems and physical inactivity.\n*   Her research has critically examined the landscape of health information during crises, including understanding <u>AI-generated misinformation</u> and evaluating human and algorithmic solutions. She has also mapped and analyzed COVID-19 crisis visualizations and investigated how older adults utilize crisis informatics technology, contributing to more informed public health responses and resilience during emergencies.\n*   Recently, Dr. Parker has focused on developing **culturally relevant digital mental health solutions for perinatal Black women**, a population that disproportionately experiences mental health challenges and social stressors. This work, recognized by a 2023 Google Award for Inclusion Research, aims to establish new collaborations with community partners to address maternal health inequities.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Parker earned her **B.S. in Computer Science** from *Northeastern University* in 2005 and subsequently completed her **Ph.D. in Human-Centered Computing** from the *Georgia Institute of Technology* in 2011, under the advisement of Dr. Rebecca E. Grinter. She also undertook a postdoctoral fellowship in the Everyday Computing Lab at Georgia Tech. Prior to her current role at Georgia Tech, she served as an *Assistant Professor* at Northeastern University with joint appointments in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the Bouvé College of Health Sciences.

We find a surprising number of cryptographic mistakes in the standard. In the most egregious cases, these mistakes enable attack vectors that allow us to recover the entire underlying plaintext IP. Some of these attack vectors are well-known, e.g. padding-oracle attacks. Others are new, and are made possible by the need to support the typical uses of the underlying IP; in particular, the need for commercial system-on-chip (SoC) tools to synthesize multiple pieces of IP into a fully specified chip design and to provide syntax errors. We exploit these mistakes in a variety of ways, leveraging a commercial SoC tool as a black-box oracle. In addition to being able to recover entire plaintext IP, we show how to produce standard-compliant …","Hardware Security, Applied Cryptography, Cybersecurity, Cyber-Physical Systems Security, Network Security, Reverse Engineering, Intellectual Property Protection, Machine Learning Security, Embedded Systems Security, Digital Forensics","## Overview\n\n**Animesh Chhotaray** is currently a *Research Scientist I* in the **School of Cybersecurity and Privacy** within the *College of Computing* at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**.

Animesh Garg,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zp8V7ZMAAAAJ&hl=en,zp8V7ZMAAAAJ,"Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Toronto",12321,"Robotic Manipulation, Robot Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, Computer Vision",http://animesh.garg.tech/,"Task planning can require defining myriad domain knowledge about the world in which a robot needs to act. To ameliorate that effort, large language models (LLMs) can be used to score potential next actions during task planning, and even generate action sequences directly, given an instruction in natural language with no additional domain information. However, such methods either require enumerating all possible next steps for scoring, or generate free-form text that may contain actions not possible on a given robot in its current context. We present a programmatic LLM prompt structure that enables plan generation functional across situated environments, robot capabilities, and tasks. Our key insight is to prompt the LLM with program-like specifications of the available actions and objects in an environment, as well as with example programs that can be executed. We make concrete recommendations about prompt structure and generation constraints through ablation experiments, demonstrate state of the art success rates in VirtualHome household tasks, and deploy our method on a physical robot arm for tabletop tasks.

We illustrate some of the issues that practitioners face when using a goal-based approach to specify the requirements for a system and close the paper with a discussion of needed future research on goal-based requirements analysis and evolution.","Software Engineering, Requirements Engineering, Privacy Engineering, Security Engineering, Regulatory Compliance, Legal Informatics, Information Policy, Human-Computer Interaction, Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Representation","## Overview\n\n**Dr. Annie I.

Among approaches to realize probabilistic inference in deep neural networks, variational Bayes (VB) is theoretically grounded, generally applicable, and computationally efficient. With wide recognition of potential advantages, why is it that variational Bayes has seen very limited practical use for BNNs in real applications? We argue that variational inference in neural networks is fragile: successful implementations require careful initialization and tuning of prior variances, as well as controlling the variance of Monte Carlo gradient estimates. We provide two innovations that aim to turn VB into a robust inference tool for Bayesian neural networks: first, we introduce a novel deterministic method to approximate moments in neural networks, eliminating gradient variance; second, we introduce a hierarchical prior for parameters and a novel Empirical Bayes procedure for automatically selecting prior variances. Combining these two innovations, the resulting method is highly efficient and robust. On the application of heteroscedastic regression we demonstrate good predictive performance over alternative approaches.","Computational Neuroscience, Machine Learning, Statistical Modeling, Deep Learning, Bayesian Inference, Reinforcement Learning, Time Series Analysis, Computer Vision, Robotics, Probabilistic Graphical Models","## Overview\n\n**Anqi Wu** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE)** within the *College of Computing* at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**.

We conducted a study of biologically inspired design in the context of an interdisciplinary introductory course on biologically inspired engineering design in Fall of 2006. The goals of this study were to understand the process of biologically inspired engineering design and to provide insight into biologically inspired design as a type of design activity. This paper provides a descriptive account of biologically inspired design processes and products, and summarizes our main observations: 1) designers use two distinct starting points for biologically inspired design; 2) regular patterns of practice emerge in biologically inspired design; and 3) certain errors occur regularly in the design process.","Computational Design, Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science, Educational Technology, Design Reasoning, Case-Based Reasoning, Model-Based Reasoning, Knowledge Representation, Human-Computer Interaction, Online Education","## Overview\n\n**Ashok K.

The same communication framework also works between devices that have the same physical layer, which are out of communication range but within carrier-sense range. Esense is based on sensing and interpreting energy profiles. While our ideas are generic enough to be applicable in a variety of contexts, we illustrate the usefulness of our ideas by presenting novel solutions to existing problems in three distinct research domains. As part of these solutions, we demonstrate the ability to communicate between devices that follow two different standards: IEEE 802.11 and 802.15.4. We build an ``alphabet set'': a set of signature packet sizes which can be used for Esense. For this, we take a measurement based approach by considering WiFi traces from actual deployments.

How quickly does a piece of news spread over these media? How does its popularity diminish over time? Does the rising and falling pattern follow a simple universal law? In this paper, we propose SpikeM, a concise yet flexible analytical model for the rise and fall patterns of influence propagation. Our model has the following advantages: (a) unification power: it generalizes and explains earlier theoretical models and empirical observations; (b) practicality: it matches the observed behavior of diverse sets of real data; (c) parsimony: it requires only a handful of parameters; and (d) usefulness: it enables further analytics tasks such as fore- casting, spotting anomalies, and interpretation by reverse- engineering the system parameters of interest (e.g. quality of news …","Network Science, Epidemic Modeling, Machine Learning, Data Science, Graph Theory, Time Series Analysis, Artificial Intelligence, Computational Epidemiology, Information Diffusion, Forecasting","## Overview\n\n**B.

Our goal is to develop and draw attention to design practices that are relevant to participatory design of learning environments and learning technologies and that directly involve learners, teachers, and other community members in all the different steps of designing. Learner-centered and design-based approaches in the learning sciences are, like participatory design (PD), founded on the principle that target populations are best served when designs address the needs of community members. PD focuses on giving such stakeholders a high degree of agency throughout the design process, emphasizing the cultivation of knowledge communities in which content and expertise are co-created by experts and other participants working in concert.

Bo Dai,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TIKl_foAAAAJ&hl=en,TIKl_foAAAAJ,Google Brain & Georgia Tech,8537,Machine Learning,https://bo-dai.github.io/,"Kernel classifiers and regressors designed for structured data, such as sequences, trees and graphs, have significantly advanced a number of interdisciplinary areas such as computational biology and drug design. Typically, kernels are designed beforehand for a data type which either exploit statistics of the structures or make use of probabilistic generative models, and then a discriminative classifier is learned based on the kernels via convex optimization. However, such an elegant two-stage approach also limited kernel methods from scaling up to millions of data points, and exploiting discriminative information to learn feature representations. We propose, structure2vec, an effective and scalable approach for structured data representation based on the idea of embedding latent variable models into feature spaces, and learning such feature spaces using discriminative information. Interestingly, structure2vec extracts features by performing a sequence of function mappings in a way similar to graphical model inference procedures, such as mean field and belief propagation. In applications involving millions of data points, we showed that structure2vec runs 2 times faster, produces models which are 10,000 times smaller, while at the same time achieving the state-of-the-art predictive performance.","Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Generative Models, Representation Learning, Optimization, Structured Data Analysis, Probabilistic Graphical Models, Kernel Methods, Computer Vision","## Overview\n\n**Bo Dai** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Computational Science & Engineering (CSE)** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

Our approach utilizes multi-material microstructures as low-level building blocks of the object. We start by precomputing the material property gamut—the set of bulk material properties that can be achieved with all material microstructures of a given size. We represent the boundary of this material property gamut using a level set field. Next, we propose an efficient and general topology optimization algorithm that simultaneously computes an optimal object topology and spatially varying material properties constrained by the precomputed gamut. Finally, we map the optimal spatially varying material properties onto the microstructures with the corresponding properties to generate a high-resolution printable structure. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework by …","Computational Fluid Dynamics, Topology Optimization, Scientific Machine Learning, Computer Graphics, Computational Physics, Continuum Mechanics, Numerical Analysis, Solid Mechanics, Mechanical Engineering, Robotics","## Overview\n\n**Bo Zhu** is currently an *Associate Professor* in the **School of Interactive Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

Such attack patterns leave their footprints spatio-temporally dispersed across many different logs in victim machines. However, existing log-mining intrusion analysis systems typically target only a single type of log to discover evidence of an attack and therefore fail to exploit fundamental inter-log connections. The output of such single-log analysis can hardly reveal the complete attack story for complex, multi-stage attacks. Additionally, some existing approaches require heavyweight system instrumentation, which makes them impractical to deploy in real production environments. To address these problems, we present HERCULE, an automated multi-stage log-based intrusion analysis system. Inspired by graph analytics research in social network analysis, we model multi-stage intrusion analysis as a community discovery problem …","Cybersecurity, Digital Forensics, Malware Analysis, Systems Security, Software Engineering, Computer Architecture, Network Security, Cloud Computing, Program Analysis, Operating Systems","## Overview\n\n**Brendan D.

Due to physical limitations in deploying actual pheromones, we propose a sparse representation of the pheromones using movable beacons. There is no communication between the beacons to propagate pheromones; instead, robots make movement and update decisions based entirely on local pheromone values. Robots deploy the beacons throughout the environment, and subsequently move them and update them using a variation of value iteration. Simulation results show that our approach is effective at finding good trails, locally improving them, and adapting to dynamic changes in the environments.","Multiagent Systems, Machine Learning, Behavioral Ecology, Animal Behavior Modeling, Robotics, Computer Vision, Simulation, Data Mining, Social Network Analysis, Collective Behavior","## Overview\n\n**Brian Hrolenok** is currently an *Assistant Professor (Teaching)* in the **Department of Computer Science** at *George Mason University*.

Brian Magerko,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6VFGjPYAAAAJ&hl=en,6VFGjPYAAAAJ,Regents Professor of Digital Media at Georgia Tech,8065,"creativity and cognition, computational media, computer science education, embodied interaction, AI",https://expressivemachinery.gatech.edu/,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly integrated in user-facing technology, but public understanding of these technologies is often limited. There is a need for additional HCI research investigating a) what competencies users need in order to effectively interact with and critically evaluate AI and b) how to design learner-centered AI technologies that foster increased user understanding of AI. This paper takes a step towards realizing both of these goals by providing a concrete definition of AI literacy based on existing research. We synthesize a variety of interdisciplinary literature into a set of core competencies of AI literacy and suggest several design considerations to support AI developers and educators in creating learner-centered AI. These competencies and design considerations are organized in a conceptual framework thematically derived from the literature.

He also serves as the *Director of Graduate Studies in Digital Media* and leads the **Expressive Machinery Lab** at Georgia Tech. His primary research focuses on exploring the intersection of <u>human and machine cognition to create novel human-computer creative experiences</u>. He integrates cognitive science, computer science, and computational media research to understand social collaboration and creativity between humans and artificial intelligence.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Magerko specializes in a broad range of research domains, including **creativity and cognition**, **computational media**, and **computer science education**. His expertise extends to <u>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</u>, *Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)*, *embodied interaction*, *interactive storytelling*, and *game design*. Additionally, his work encompasses *educational technology*, *human-robot interaction*, and the study of improvisational cognition and its computational modeling. He investigates how expression and meaning-making can motivate students to learn computing and how to quantify creative social interactions.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Magerko co-founded **EarSketch**, a highly influential music-based learning environment that teaches computer programming through the creation of hip-hop tracks. This platform has been adopted across all 50 U.S. states and engaged over a million learners worldwide, significantly increasing positive attitudes toward computing, especially among underrepresented populations.\n*   His research has extensively contributed to the field of **AI literacy**, defining essential competencies for users to effectively interact with and critically evaluate AI technologies. He has designed learner-centered AI experiences, including co-creative AI literacy exhibits for informal learning spaces, to foster public understanding of AI. This work is supported by significant federal grants aimed at broadening AI literacy.\n*   He has done foundational work in **co-creative AI and interactive drama**, developing intelligent systems that can collaborate creatively with humans as partners. This includes creating AI characters and directors for interactive computer games and pioneering the use of drama management in interactive narrative experiences. Notably, his work has led to ""improv robot comedy troops"" and even the world's first improvised human-AI dance performance, ""LuminAI"".\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Magerko earned his **B.S. in Cognitive Science** from *Carnegie Mellon University* in 1999. He then pursued his graduate studies at the *University of Michigan*, where he received his **M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering** in 2001 and 2006, respectively.\n\nBefore joining the **Georgia Institute of Technology** in 2008, he served as an *Assistant Professor in Digital Games* at *Michigan State University*. Dr. Magerko has been a research lead on over $20 million in federally-funded research and has authored more than 100 peer-reviewed articles. His innovative work has garnered international recognition, being featured in major media outlets such as *The New Yorker*, *USA Today*, *CNN*, and *NPR*, and exhibited in galleries and museums worldwide. He has also received multiple keynote presentations and top paper awards.",14.129398,4.709898,"[-0.3219785690307617, 0.01725975051522255, 0.4286693334579468, -0.3227185010910034, 0.0379287526011467,

Buffer overflow attacks gained notoriety in 1988 as part of the Morris Worm incident on the Internet. While it is fairly simple to fix individual buffer overflow vulnerabilities, buffer overflow attacks continue to this day. Hundreds of attacks have been discovered, and while most of the obvious vulnerabilities have now been patched, more sophisticated buffer overflow attacks continue to emerge.We describe StackGuard: a simple compiler technique that virtually eliminates buffer overflow vulnerabilities with only modest performance penalties. Privileged programs that are recompiled with the StackGuard compiler extension no longer yield control to the attacker, but rather enter a fail-safe state. These programs require no source code changes at all, and are binary-compatible with existing operating systems and libraries.

Carl DiSalvo (he / him),https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YR1EmaAAAAAJ&hl=en,YR1EmaAAAAAJ,Georgia Institute of Technology,12008,Design,Homepage not specified,"An exploration of the political qualities of technology design, as seen in projects that span art, computer science, and consumer products. In Adversarial Design, Carl DiSalvo examines the ways that technology design can provoke and engage the political. He describes a practice, which he terms “adversarial design,” that uses the means and forms of design to challenge beliefs, values, and what is taken to be fact. It is not simply applying design to politics—attempting to improve governance for example, by redesigning ballots and polling places; it is implicitly contestational and strives to question conventional approaches to political issues. DiSalvo explores the political qualities and potentials of design by examining a series of projects that span design and art, engineering and computer science, agitprop and consumer products. He views these projects—which include computational visualizations of networks of power and influence, therapy robots that shape sociability, and everyday objects embedded with microchips that enable users to circumvent surveillance—through the lens of agonism, a political theory that emphasizes contention as foundational to democracy. DiSalvo's illuminating analysis aims to provide design criticism with a new approach for thinking about the relationship between forms of political expression, computation as a medium, and the processes and products of design.","Human-Computer Interaction, Design Studies, Participatory Design, Robotics, Sustainability, Speculative Design, Critical Design, Sociology of Technology, Civic Technology, Qualitative Research Methods","## Overview\n\n**Carl DiSalvo** is currently an *Associate Professor* in the **College of Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*, with appointments in both the School of Interactive Computing and the School of Literature, Media, and Communication. He directs the **Public Design Workshop** and the **Experimental Civics Studio** at Georgia Tech. His primary research explores the intricate relationship between <u>design and democracy</u>, focusing on how technology design can engage political discourse and foster collective action. He is particularly interested in how communities leverage data for political objectives and how their data practices shape new forms of civic engagement, along with challenging conventional notions of computing to broaden participation.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. DiSalvo specializes in a broad spectrum of research areas, including **Design Studies**, **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, and the **Sociology of Technology**. His expertise encompasses *Participatory Design*, *Speculative Design*, *Critical Design*, and *Civic Technology*, with a strong emphasis on qualitative research methods. He investigates **human-robot interaction**, *sustainability in HCI*, and the ethical implications of technology in urban environments, including smart cities and the Internet of Things (IoT). His work also delves into how design can contribute to diverse economies, food systems, and environmental monitoring, often drawing upon art, craft, and activism to expand the field of design.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. DiSalvo's seminal work, ""Adversarial Design,"" introduced a framework for understanding how technology design can actively engage and provoke political discourse. This research examines how design can be used to challenge prevailing beliefs and values, showcasing projects that bridge art, computer science, and consumer products to instigate critical societal reflection.\n*   Through his book, ""Design as Democratic Inquiry,"" Dr. DiSalvo advocates for ""doing design otherwise,"" presenting an approach where design experiments contribute to the continuous renewal and care of local democracies. This work highlights collaborative projects with communities and institutions in Atlanta, demonstrating how design can foster a more diverse civic imagination by embracing practices that are fragile, contingent, and community-grounded.\n*   His early and influential ethnographic research on domestic service robots, such as the Roomba vacuum, provided foundational insights into **human-robot interaction** within the home environment. This work offered a grounded understanding of how robot design profoundly influences user experience and perception, thereby informing future developments in consumer robotics and ambient assistive technologies for independent living.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. DiSalvo earned his **Ph.D. in Design** from *Carnegie Mellon University* in 2006. Following his doctoral studies, he served as a **postdoctoral fellow** at *Carnegie Mellon University* from 2006 to 2007, holding joint appointments in the Studio for Creative Inquiry and the Center for the Arts in Society. His career trajectory at Georgia Tech saw him progress from an Assistant Professor of Digital Media to his current role as an Associate Professor in the College of Computing. In recognition of his significant contributions to the field of Human-Computer Interaction, he was inducted into the **SIGCHI Academy** in 2025. He was also honored with the **STS Infrastructure Award** from the Society for the Social Studies of Science in 2025 as a co-editor of the DigitalSTS Handbook. Additionally, he served as the *James Wei Visiting Professor* at the **Keller Center** at Princeton University for the 2024-2025 academic year.\n- Dr. DiSalvo is actively involved in the academic community as a **co-editor** of the prestigious *MIT Press journal Design Issues*.\n- He also contributes to interdisciplinary initiatives, serving on the steering committee of the **Atlanta Interdisciplinary Artificial Intelligence Network**, which explores the ethical and equitable enlistment of AI through a humanities lens.",12.607303,3.8685195,"[-0.181063711643219,

While hijack detection systems are readily available, they typically rely on a priori prefix-ownership information and are reactive in nature. In this work, we take on a new perspective on BGP hijacking activity: we introduce and track the long-term routing behavior of serial hijackers, networks that repeatedly hijack address blocks for malicious purposes, often over the course of many months or even years. Based on a ground truth dataset that we construct by extracting information from network operator mailing lists, we illuminate the dominant routing characteristics of serial hijackers, and how they differ from legitimate networks. We then distill features that can capture these behavioral differences and train a machine learning model to automatically identify Autonomous Systems (ASes) that exhibit characteristics similar to serial …","Internet Routing Security, Network Protocol Analysis, Network Measurement and Monitoring, Cybersecurity Policy, Internet Governance, Cryptographic Security, Data Mining and Machine Learning for Security, Internet Architecture and Design, Network Resilience, Internet Traffic Analysis","## Overview\n\n**Cecilia Testart** is an *Assistant Professor* with joint appointments in the **School of Cybersecurity and Privacy** and the **School of Computer Science** at *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

However, traffic forecasting has always been considered an “open” scientific issue, owing to the constraints of urban road network topological structure and the law of dynamic change with time. To capture the spatial and temporal dependences simultaneously, we propose a novel neural network-based traffic forecasting method, the temporal graph convolutional network (T-GCN) model, which is combined with the graph convolutional network (GCN) and the gated recurrent unit (GRU). Specifically, the GCN is used to learn complex topological structures for capturing spatial dependence and the gated recurrent unit is used to learn dynamic changes of traffic data for capturing temporal dependence. Then, the T-GCN model is …","Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Recommender Systems, Spatiotemporal Data Analysis, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Graph Neural Networks, Data Mining, Information Extraction","## Overview\n\n**Chao Zhang** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Computational Science and Engineering** within the **College of Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

As part of this paper, we (1) summarize the state of the science on critical team competencies identified for effective HMT, (2) discuss technological gaps preventing machines from fully realizing these competencies, and (3) identify ways that emerging artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities may address these gaps and enhance performance in HMT. We extend beyond extant literature by incorporating recent technologies and techniques and describing their potential for contributing to the advancement of HMT.","Artificial Intelligence in Education, Cognitive Modeling, Human-Computer Interaction, Educational Technology, Machine Learning, Cognitive Systems, Computational Linguistics, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Human-AI Teaming, Educational Data Mining","## Overview\n\n**Christopher J. MacLellan** is an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Interactive Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*, where he leads the **Teachable AI Lab (TAIL)**.

She directs the **Critical Technocultures Lab**, where her primary research centers on the <u>data practices, exchanges, and expertise of climate change</u> and their relationship to **environmental governance** in Indonesia and the United States. Her current book project, *The Volatile World: Agile Governance, AI, and the Politics of Fire Prediction in Indonesia*, investigates how environmental data and artificial intelligence are employed to predict and manage highly volatile fires in Indonesia's tropical peatland.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Lin specializes in a diverse range of research areas, including **Science and Technology Studies (STS)**, **Critical Data Studies**, and **Feminist Technoscience**. Her work extensively explores **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, *Postcolonial Studies*, **Digital Humanities**, and **Environmental Studies**, particularly focusing on the intersection of these fields with **sociotechnical systems** and **AI Ethics**. She is also engaged in *Design Studies*, examining how technology is shaped by and, in turn, shapes societal values and power dynamics. Her scholarship frequently addresses themes of **digital precarity**, *techno-optimism*, and the ethical implications of data and AI in various global contexts.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Lin has significantly contributed to understanding the role of **Artificial Intelligence in Earth sciences** by providing a comprehensive overview of its applications and potential for innovation. This work has been instrumental in advocating for improved accuracy, enhanced model intelligence, scalability, and cost reduction in Earth system sciences, guiding future research and development in this critical area.\n*   Through her research, she has critically examined **HCI's foundational value systems**, particularly the commitments to usefulness and the ideal of technology enabling social progress. This work reveals how these seemingly positive ideals can inadvertently mask *colonial othering, racist exclusions, and exploitation*, urging the field to consider a more ethical and just approach to computing and design.\n*   Co-authoring the books *Technoprecarious* and *Digital Energetics*, Dr. Lin has provided crucial analytical frameworks for understanding the **entangled relationship between digital technology and various forms of precarity** across geographical sites and cultural practices. These contributions highlight how digital infrastructures impact energy consumption and labor relations in a warming world, fostering a deeper understanding of contemporary sociotechnical issues.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Lin earned her **Ph.D. in Information** from the *School of Information (UMSI) at the University of Michigan*, where she also received a graduate certificate. Her doctoral research was recognized with the **ProQuest Distinguished Dissertation Award**.\n\nPrior to her current role at *Georgia Tech*, she held positions as an **Assistant Professor** at the *College of Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State*, and as a **Postdoctoral Fellow** at the *Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability* and the *Department of Information Science at Cornell University*. She was also a *Digital Life Initiative Visiting Fellow at Cornell Tech*. Her academic journey is marked by a strong interdisciplinary focus, bridging computing, social sciences, and humanities, with a consistent emphasis on **environmental justice** and **decolonial approaches** to technology. Her graduate studies and research have been supported by prestigious grants from the **National Science Foundation** and the **Dow Sustainability Fellows Program**.",12.650174,3.9233527,"[-0.15346312522888184, 0.20509260892868042, 0.4658689498901367, -0.16338545083999634, 0.2902154326438904, 0.07523595541715622, 0.2132681906223297, 0.3759150803089142,

But that means that two people can see different patterns in the same visualization, potentially leading to miscommunication. Here, we show that when people are primed to see one pattern in the data as visually salient, they believe that naïve viewers will experience the same visual salience. Participants were told one of multiple backstories about political events that affected public polling data, before viewing a graph that depicted those data. One pattern in the data was particularly visually salient to them given the backstory that they heard. They then predicted what naïve viewers would most visually salient on the visualization. They were strongly influenced by their own knowledge, despite explicit instructions to ignore it, predicting that others would find the same patterns to be most visually salient.

Her primary research centers on the intersection of <u>visual perception, cognition, and data visualization</u>. She investigates how the design of visualizations influences human understanding, decision-making, and critical thinking. A key objective of her work is to develop models to measure and enhance <u>trust in human-data interaction</u> through effective visual data communication.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Xiong Bearfield specializes in a broad range of research areas, including **Information Visualization**, **Visual Perception**, **Decision Making**, **Cognitive Psychology**, and **Human-Computer Interaction**. Her expertise also extends to *Decision Science, Data Communication, Experimental Psychology, Computer Vision, Machine Learning Interpretability,* and *Educational Psychology*. She actively examines cognitive and perceptual biases in visual data interpretation, such as the *curse of knowledge* and the *illusion of causality*, and explores how these biases can be mitigated or amplified by visualization design choices. Her work also delves into the ethical implications of visualization, including its impact on *social outcomes* and *political polarization*.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Xiong Bearfield has made significant contributions by revealing how **pre-existing beliefs and visualization designs** can introduce cognitive biases, such as the ""curse of knowledge"" and the ""illusion of causality,"" in how viewers interpret data. Her research highlights that people may perceive different patterns from the same visualization, influencing their causal reasoning and potentially leading to miscommunication. This work provides crucial insights for designing visualizations that promote more objective and accurate data interpretation by anticipating and mitigating these inherent biases.\n*   She has developed **frameworks for evaluating data visualizations** across different levels of human understanding, drawing inspiration from educational literature like Bloom's taxonomy. This foundational work helps practitioners diagnose how effectively visualizations support a viewer's ability to extract facts, understand context, and draw conclusions. Additionally, her empirical evaluations of design guidelines, such as ""declutter and focus,"" offer practical strategies for creating clearer and more efficient visual data communication.\n*   A core aspect of her research explores the **multidimensional nature of trust in data visualizations** and its critical role in decision-making. Her studies examine how elements like metadata, transparency, and specific design choices impact a viewer's trust. This includes investigating how visual designs affect perceived bias in machine learning models, ultimately aiming to foster ""calibrated trust"" where users critically evaluate information and contribute to the development of more responsible and fair AI systems.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Xiong Bearfield earned her **Ph.D. in Psychology** from *Northwestern University*. Before joining *Georgia Tech*, she served as an **Assistant Professor** at the *College of Information and Computer Science* at the University of Massachusetts Amherst from 2021 to 2024. While at UMass, she was awarded a prestigious **National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award**. Her career trajectory demonstrates a strong interdisciplinary approach, combining cognitive science with computer science to address fundamental questions in data visualization and human-computer interaction. She is also actively involved with the **IEEE Computer Society Technical Community on Visualization and Graphics**, serving on its Executive Committee.",12.515028,6.25558,"[-0.07709573209285736,

This paper proposes a novel, fine-grained approach to regional delineation, based on analyzing networks of billions of individual human transactions. Given a geographical area and some measure of the strength of links between its inhabitants, we show how to partition the area into smaller, non-overlapping regions while minimizing the disruption to each person's links. We tested our method on the largest non-Internet human network, inferred from a large telecommunications database in Great Britain. Our partitioning algorithm yields geographically cohesive regions that correspond remarkably well with administrative regions, while unveiling unexpected spatial structures that had previously only been hypothesized in the literature. We also quantify the effects of partitioning, showing for instance that the effects of a possible secession of Wales from Great Britain would be twice as disruptive for the human network than that of Scotland.","Geographic Information Science, Urban Planning, Social Network Analysis, Spatial Data Analysis, Human Geography, Information Visualization, Urban Mobility, Computational Social Science, Geospatial Privacy, Machine Learning in Geography","## Overview\n\n**Clio Andris** is currently an *Associate Professor* in both the **School of City and Regional Planning** and the **School of Interactive Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*. She also serves as the **Co-Director** of the **MS-GIST Program**. Dr. Andris directs the **Friendly Cities Lab**, where her primary research focuses on utilizing <u>geographic information science, social networks, and spatial networks</u> to understand and model human interactions and their impact on urban environments. Her work specifically explores how these interactions shape cities, influence urban planning, and can be visualized through advanced geovisualization techniques.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Andris specializes in a diverse range of interconnected research areas, prominently including **Geographic Information Science (GIScience)**, **Urban Planning**, and **Social Network Analysis**. Her expertise extends to *Information Visualization* and *Geovisualization*, where she develops tools and methods to represent complex spatial and social data. Key areas of her specialization also encompass <u>Spatial Data Analysis, Human Geography, Urban Mobility, Computational Social Science, Geospatial Privacy, and Machine Learning in Geography</u>. A significant portion of her research involves developing mathematical models of social networks, social flows, and interpersonal relationships to better understand how these dynamics influence urban spaces and aid in creating more connected and responsive cities.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Andris has made significant contributions to regional analysis by developing a novel approach to <u>delineate geographical regions based on actual human interaction networks</u>. This method leverages billions of individual human transactions to partition areas in a way that minimizes disruption to people's existing social and economic links, offering a more natural and socially informed understanding of regional boundaries.\n*   Her research has also provided crucial insights into urban mobility by systematically analyzing large-scale digital traces of individuals, such as taxi drivers. This work reveals underlying <u>behavioral patterns and ""mobility intelligence,""</u> demonstrating how digital footprints can be used to understand operational strategies and movement dynamics within complex urban contexts.\n*   During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Andris led the development of a <u>real-time, interactive online dashboard</u> that estimated the risk of SARS-CoV-2 presence in gatherings at the U.S. county level. This tool provided vital geolocalized risk information to the public, aiding in informed decision-making regarding events and gatherings and helping to counteract risk misestimation.\n*   Furthermore, her work profoundly impacts urban planning by enriching **Points of Interest (POI) data** with information about social relationships, visitor diversity, and the prevalence of chain establishments versus independent businesses. This research helps urban planners identify amenities that best support <u>personal relationships and foster unique, authentic local landscapes</u>, ultimately contributing to the design of more ""friendly cities.""\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Andris earned her **Ph.D. in Urban Information Systems** from the *Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)* in 2011, where she was an **NDSEG fellow** and a member of the **Senseable City Lab**. Following her doctoral studies, she held postdoctoral positions at the *Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology* and the *Santa Fe Institute*.\n\nPrior to joining *Georgia Tech*, she served as a faculty member in the **Department of Geography** at *Penn State University*. Her significant achievements include receiving an **NSF CAREER award in 2021**. Dr. Andris actively contributes to the broader geospatial community, serving on the **National Geospatial Advisory Committee**. Her academic journey highlights a consistent focus on the intersection of geography, computing, and urban studies, fostering innovative approaches to understanding and shaping cities.",7.6496234,2.78582,"[-0.07829145342111588, -0.285577654838562, 0.3805316090583801, -0.11858493089675903, 0.31648141145706177, 0.10982450842857361, 0.4391465187072754, 0.2354452908039093,

Bandwidth estimation is of interest to users wishing to optimize end-to-end transport performance, overlay network routing, and peer-to-peer file distribution. Techniques for accurate bandwidth estimation are also important for traffic engineering and capacity planning support. Existing bandwidth estimation tools measure one or more of three related metrics: capacity, available bandwidth, and bulk transfer capacity. Currently available bandwidth estimation tools employ a variety of strategies to measure these metrics. In this survey we review the recent bandwidth estimation literature focusing on underlying techniques and methodologies as well as open source bandwidth measurement tools.","Network Measurement and Analysis, Internet Architecture and Protocols, Quality of Service (QoS) and Differentiated Services, Congestion Control and Performance, Adaptive Streaming and Multimedia Networking, Network Security and Routing (BGP), Computational Science and Modeling, Machine Learning for Networks, Network Economics and Ecosystems, Distributed Systems and Overlay Networks","## Overview\n\n**Constantine Dovrolis** is currently a *Professor of Computer Science* at the **Georgia Institute of Technology** and also serves as the <u>Director of the Center for Computational Science and Technology (CaSToRC)</u> at *The Cyprus Institute* as of January 1, 2023.

The network learns a mapping from images of objects to their underlying 3D shapes from a large collection of synthetic data . Our network takes in one or more images of an object instance from arbitrary viewpoints and outputs a reconstruction of the object in the form of a 3D occupancy grid. Unlike most of the previous works, our network does not require any image annotations or object class labels for training or testing. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that our reconstruction framework (i) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for single view reconstruction, and (ii) enables the 3D reconstruction of objects in situations when traditional SFM/SLAM methods fail (because …","Robotics, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, Task and Motion Planning, 3D Reconstruction, Object Pose Estimation, Motion Planning, Deep Learning","## Overview\n\n**Danfei Xu** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Interactive Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*, and also holds a position as a *part-time Research Scientist* at **NVIDIA AI**. His primary research goal is to enable <u>physical autonomy in everyday human environments</u> with minimal expert intervention, integrating principles from **Robotics, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision**. Dr. Xu's work focuses on advancing visuomotor skill learning, developing structured world models for long-horizon planning, and exploring data-driven approaches to human-robot collaboration.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Xu specializes in a broad range of research areas at the intersection of robotics and artificial intelligence. His expertise encompasses **Robot Learning, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, and Imitation Learning**. Key areas of specialization also include *3D Reconstruction, Object Pose Estimation, Motion Planning, and Deep Learning*. He is particularly interested in the development of <u>compositional and generalizable structures</u> in robotics and vision, as well as scene understanding in both 2D and 3D. His current endeavors emphasize generative models for robot training and validation, and developing new machine learning models for robots to *self-adapt and improve ""on-the-job""*.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Xu has made significant contributions to <u>3D object reconstruction</u>, proposing a unified recurrent neural network architecture that enabled robust 3D shape recovery from single or multiple images by learning from large synthetic datasets.\n*   He developed a novel framework for **6D object pose estimation from RGB-D images**, which substantially improved performance in highly cluttered scenes and facilitated real-time applications by effectively fusing complementary data sources.\n*   His work on leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for generating robot task plans has significantly reduced the need for extensive domain knowledge, allowing robots to synthesize action sequences directly from natural language instructions and achieve complex, long-horizon tasks. This effort was recognized when *Open X-Embodiment* won the Best Conference Paper at ICRA'24.\n*   More recently, Dr. Xu received the *NSF CAREER Award* for his pioneering research on developing **new machine learning models** that enable robots to self-improve and adapt their skillsets based on performance feedback and user preferences in diverse real-world settings, thereby accelerating robot deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Danfei Xu earned his **B.S. in Computer Science** from *Columbia University* in 2015 and subsequently completed his **Ph.D. in Computer Science** from *Stanford University* in 2021.

This approach is pragmatic, but this focus may not align with the bottom-up interests of the available student body. As part of a broader effort to expand the available research opportunities in a graduate program in computer science, this work focuses on collecting data on what is motivating student interest in research and what specific fields students desire to study with the intention of using the results for decision-making about how to allocate resources to best match student interests. This work reports on the responses of 143 graduate students in computer science at a major research institution in the United States in a course-based program where access to research opportunities is not guaranteed.

In this study, we experimented with a model of seven principles drawn from instructional design theories for designing and developing video lessons for an online graduate course. Feedback was collected from students through surveys on their perceptions of the effectiveness of the video lessons and the overall course quality for eight semesters. This paper shares the instructors' experience on the design and development of the video lessons as well as the survey findings. Implications of the findings for instructional design and future research are also discussed.","Educational Technology, Online Learning, Artificial Intelligence in Education, Computer Science Education, Learning Analytics, Instructional Design, Human-Computer Interaction, Educational Data Mining, Digital Pedagogy, Educational Assessment","## Overview\n\n**David A.

Divya Mahajan,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HmBa_6gAAAAJ&hl=en,HmBa_6gAAAAJ,Georgia Tech,2060,"Computer Architecture, System Infrastructure Design, Machine Learning, Domain Specfic Accelerator",https://www.divyamahajan.com/,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are compute-intensive learning models with growing applicability in a wide range of domains. FPGAs are an attractive choice for DNNs since they offer a programmable substrate for acceleration and are becoming available across different market segments. However, obtaining both performance and energy efficiency with FPGAs is a laborious task even for expert hardware designers. Furthermore, the large memory footprint of DNNs, coupled with the FPGAs' limited on-chip storage makes DNN acceleration using FPGAs more challenging. This work tackles these challenges by devising DnnWeaver, a framework that automatically generates a synthesizable accelerator for a given (DNN, FPGA) pair from a high-level specification in Caffe [1]. To achieve large benefits while preserving automation, DNNWEAVER generates accelerators using hand-optimized design templates.

However, because of the internal complexity and nonlinear structure of deep neural networks, the underlying decision making processes for why these models are achieving such performance are challenging and sometimes mystifying to interpret. As deep learning spreads across domains, it is of paramount importance that we equip users of deep learning with tools for understanding when a model works correctly, when it fails, and ultimately how to improve its performance. Standardized toolkits for building neural networks have helped democratize deep learning; visual analytics systems have now been developed to support model explanation, interpretation, debugging, and improvement. We present a survey of the role of visual analytics in deep …","Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, Computer Vision, Network Analysis, Human-Computer Interaction, Information Visualization, Cybersecurity, Software Engineering, Natural Language Processing","## Overview\n\n**Duen Horng (Polo) Chau** is currently a *Professor* in the **School of Computational Science and Engineering** within the *College of Computing* at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**, where he also co-directs the **MS Analytics program**.

Models of tissue electrophysiology can provide a bridge between electrophysiological cell models at smaller scales, and tissue mechanics, metabolism and blood flow at larger scales. This paper is a critical review of cardiac tissue electrophysiology models, focussing on the micro-structure of cardiac tissue, generic behaviours of action potential propagation, different models of cardiac tissue electrophysiology, the choice of parameter values and tissue geometry, emergent properties in tissue models, numerical techniques and computational issues. We propose a tentative list of information that could be included in published descriptions of tissue electrophysiology models, and used to support interpretation …","Cardiac Electrophysiology, Computational Biology, Mathematical Modeling, Nonlinear Dynamics, Complex Systems, Biomedical Engineering, Dynamical Systems Theory, Biophysics, Machine Learning, Medical Simulation","## Overview\n\n**Elizabeth M.

The method exploits knowledge of a system’s governing equations to identify a coordinate transformation in which the system dynamics have quadratic structure. This transformation is called a lifting map because it often adds auxiliary variables to the system state. The lifting map is applied to data obtained by evaluating a model for the original nonlinear system. This lifted data is projected onto its leading principal components, and low-dimensional linear and quadratic matrix operators are fit to the lifted reduced data using a least-squares operator inference procedure. Analysis of our method shows that the Lift & Learn models are able to capture the system physics in the lifted coordinates at least as accurately as traditional intrusive model reduction approaches.

A variety of graph models are found in the literature, including regular topologies such as rings or stars, ""well-known"" topologies such as the original ARPAnet, and randomly generated topologies. Less common is any discussion of how closely these models correlate with real network topologies. We consider the problem of efficiently generating graph models that accurately reflect the topological properties of real internetworks. We compare the properties of graphs generated using various methods with those of real internets. We also propose efficient methods for generating topologies with particular properties, including a transit-stub model that correlates well with the internet structure. Improved models for the internetwork structure have the potential to impact the significance of …","Computer Networks, Mobile and Wireless Networks, Internet Topology, Delay-Tolerant Networking, Software-Defined Networking, Cloud Computing, Peer-to-Peer Networks, Network Routing, Network Performance Analysis, Distributed Systems","## Overview\n\n**Ellen W.

For instance, unsuccessful recovery leads to imaging artefacts and to erroneous predictions for the multiples, adversely affecting the performance of multiple elimination. A non-parametric transform-based recovery method is presented that exploits the compression of seismic data volumes by recently developed curvelet frames. The elements of this transform are multidimensional and directional and locally resemble wave fronts present in the data, which leads to a compressible representation for seismic data. This compression enables us to formulate a new curvelet-based seismic data recovery algorithm through sparsity-promoting inversion. The concept of sparsity-promoting inversion is in itself not new to geophysics.

Developers must manually search through thousands of model-variants—versions of already-trained models that differ in hardware, resource footprints, latencies, costs, and accuracies—to meet the diverse application requirements. Since requirements, query load, and applications themselves evolve over time, these decisions need to be made dynamically for each inference query to avoid excessive costs through naive autoscaling. To avoid navigating through the large and complex trade-off space of model-variants, developers often fix a variant across queries, and replicate it when load increases. However, given the diversity across variants and hardware platforms in the cloud, a lack of understanding of the trade-off space can incur significant costs to developers.","Computer Systems and Architecture, Machine Learning Systems, Serverless Computing, Cloud Computing, Video Analytics, Database Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction, Natural Language Processing, Signal Processing","## Overview\n\n**Francisco Romero** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Computer Science** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

Thus, reliable position estimation is a key problem in mobile robotics. We believe that probabilistic approaches are among the most promising candidates to providing a comprehensive and real-time solution to the robot localization problem. However, current methods still face considerable hurdles. In particular the problems encountered are closely related to the type of representation used to represent probability densities over the robot's state space. Earlier work on Bayesian filtering with particle-based density representations opened up a new approach for mobile robot localization based on these principles. We introduce the Monte Carlo localization method, where we represent the probability density involved by maintaining a set of samples that are randomly drawn from it. By using a sampling-based representation we obtain a …","Robotics, Computer Vision, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Probabilistic Robotics, Factor Graphs, Motion Planning, 3D Reconstruction, Object Recognition, Sensor Fusion, Machine Learning","Here is a concise academic summary of Frank Dellaert:\n\n## Overview\n\n**Frank Dellaert** is currently a *Professor* in the **School of Interactive Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

Given safe demonstrations, our method uses hit-and-run sampling to obtain lower cost, and thus unsafe, trajectories. Both safe and unsafe trajectories are used to obtain a consistent representation of the unsafe set via solving an integer program. Our method generalizes across system dynamics and learns a guaranteed subset of the constraint. We also provide theoretical analysis on what subset of the constraint can be learnable from safe demonstrations. We demonstrate our method on linear and nonlinear system dynamics, show that it can be modified to work with suboptimal demonstrations, and that it can also be used to learn constraints in a feature space.","Robotics, Machine Learning, Control Theory, Optimization, Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Systems, Safe Autonomy, Human-Robot Interaction, Reinforcement Learning, Formal Methods","## Overview\n\n**Glen Chou** is an *Assistant Professor* at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**, with appointments in the **College of Computing's School of Cybersecurity & Privacy (SCP)** and the **College of Engineering's School of Aerospace Engineering (AE)**.

In our approach, patch regions from a sample image or video are transformed and copied to the output and then stitched together along optimal seams to generate a new (and typically larger) output. In contrast to other techniques, the size of the patch is not chosen a-priori, but instead a graph cut technique is used to determine the optimal patch region for any given offset between the input and output texture. Unlike dynamic programming, our graph cut technique for seam optimization is applicable in any dimension. We specifically explore it in 2D and 3D to perform video texture synthesis in addition to regular image synthesis. We present approximative offset search techniques that work well in conjunction with the presented patch size optimization. We show results for synthesizing regular, random, and natural images and videos.

The choice of LfD over other robot learning methods is compelling when ideal behavior can be neither easily scripted (as is done in traditional robot programming) nor easily defined as an optimization problem, but can be demonstrated. While there have been multiple surveys of this field in the past, there is a need for a new one given the considerable growth in the number of publications in recent years. This review aims to provide an overview of the collection of machine-learning methods used to enable a robot to learn from and imitate a teacher. We focus on recent advancements in the field and present an updated taxonomy and characterization of existing methods. We also discuss mature and emerging application areas for LfD and highlight the …","Robot Learning, Multi-Robot Systems, Human-Robot Interaction, Machine Learning, Motion Planning, Task Allocation and Scheduling, Dexterous Manipulation, Artificial Intelligence, Control Theory, Imitation Learning","## Overview\n\n**Harish Ravichandar** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Interactive Computing** and a core faculty member of the *Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines (IRIM)* at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**.

CSR excels at storing graphs compactly with minimal overhead, allowing for fast traversals, lookups, and basic graph computations such as PageRank. Since elements in CSR format are packed together, additions and deletions often require time linear in the size of the graph. We introduce a new dynamic sparse graph representation called Packed Compressed Sparse Row (PCSR), based on an array-based dynamic data structure called the Packed Memory Array. PCSR is similar to CSR, but leaves spaces between elements, allowing for asymptotically faster insertions and deletions in exchange for a constant factor slowdown in traversals and a constant factor increase in space overhead. Our contributions are twofold. We describe PCSR and review the theoretical guarantees for update, insert, and search for PCSR.

In this work, we propose a Criss-Cross Network (CCNet) for obtaining such contextual information in a more effective and efficient way. Concretely, for each pixel, a novel criss-cross attention module in CCNet harvests the contextual information of all the pixels on its criss-cross path. By taking a further recurrent operation, each pixel can finally capture the full-image dependencies from all pixels. Overall, CCNet is with the following merits: 1) GPU memory friendly. Compared with the non-local block, the proposed recurrent criss-cross attention module requires 11x less GPU memory usage. 2) High computational efficiency. The recurrent criss-cross attention significantly reduces FLOPs by about 85% of the non-local block in computing full-image dependencies. 3) The state-of-the-art performance. We conduct extensive experiments on popular semantic segmentation benchmarks including Cityscapes, ADE20K, and instance segmentation benchmark COCO. In particular, our CCNet achieves the mIoU score of 81.4 and 45.22 on Cityscapes test set and ADE20K validation set, respectively, which are the new state-of-the-art results.

Programming thousands of massively parallel threads is a big challenge for software engineers, but understanding the performance bottlenecks of those parallel programs on GPU architectures to improve application performance is even more difficult. Current approaches rely on programmers to tune their applications by exploiting the design space exhaustively without fully understanding the performance characteristics of their applications. To provide insights into the performance bottlenecks of parallel applications on GPU architectures, we propose a simple analytical model that estimates the execution time of massively parallel programs. The key component of our model is estimating the number of parallel memory requests (we call this the memory warp parallelism) by considering the number of …","Computer Architecture, Compiler Design, Parallel Computing, GPU Computing, Performance Modeling and Analysis, Memory Systems, Heterogeneous Computing, Near-Memory Computing, Deep Learning Hardware, Hardware Security","## Overview\n\n**Hyesoon Kim** is currently a *Professor* in the **School of Computer Science**, within the *College of Computing* at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**.

We investigated two variations of this paper and their affordances for tangible interaction; particularly their electrical, haptic, and visual aspects when shaped into three-dimensional forms through cutting, folding, and bending. Through this exploration, we uncovered distinct affordances between the two paper types for sensing folds and bends, due to differences in their material compositions. From these insights, we propose three applications that showcase the possibilities of this material for tangible interaction design. In addition, we leverage the pictorial format to expose working design schematics for others to take up their own explorations.","Human-Computer Interaction, Tangible Computing, Craft-based Design, Educational Technology, Wearable Technology, Robotics, Sustainable Electronics, Computational Design, Haptics, Interaction Design","## Overview\n\n**HyunJoo Oh** is currently an *Assistant Professor* with a joint appointment in the **School of Industrial Design** and the **School of Interactive Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

In our approach, patch regions from a sample image or video are transformed and copied to the output and then stitched together along optimal seams to generate a new (and typically larger) output. In contrast to other techniques, the size of the patch is not chosen a-priori, but instead a graph cut technique is used to determine the optimal patch region for any given offset between the input and output texture. Unlike dynamic programming, our graph cut technique for seam optimization is applicable in any dimension. We specifically explore it in 2D and 3D to perform video texture synthesis in addition to regular image synthesis. We present approximative offset search techniques that work well in conjunction with the presented patch size optimization. We show results for synthesizing regular, random, and natural images and videos.

Compared with reduced instruction set computer (RISC) microprocessors, complex instruction set computer (CISC) processors execute relatively complex instructions, such as multiplies, memory-indirect moves, and register exchanges. However, these CISC instructions are still much less com plex that higher-level application program code. For example, Searching a table of file mappings or trans lations requires execution of many CISC instructions to construct addresses, read from the table, compare or the data read, and to copy results or addresses to registers. When the lookup term is a long string, more CISC instructions are needed to read the string from memory and move it into the microprocessor's general-purpose registers (GPR's) before the string can be compared to table entries.

We analyze the convergence of GAN training from this new point of view to understand why mode collapse happens. We hypothesize the existence of undesirable local equilibria in this non-convex game to be responsible for mode collapse. We observe that these local equilibria often exhibit sharp gradients of the discriminator function around some real data points. We demonstrate that these degenerate local equilibria can be avoided with a gradient penalty scheme called DRAGAN. We show that DRAGAN enables faster training, achieves improved stability with fewer mode collapses, and leads to generator networks with better modeling performance across a variety of architectures and objective functions.","Online Learning, Game Theory, Optimization, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Algorithmic Game Theory, Econometrics, Financial Engineering, Data Science, Computer Science","The search results confirm that the researcher's name is **Jacob Abernethy**.\n\nIt also clarifies the affiliation conflict:\n- He was an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan from 2013 to 2017.\n- He has been an Assistant and Associate Professor at Georgia Tech's College of Computing since 2017.\n- He joined Google Research in 2022 and currently holds a dual affiliation with Google and Georgia Tech.

He also holds a position as a *Researcher* at **Google Research**, having joined in 2022. His primary research focuses on **Machine Learning**, where he explores the profound connections between *Optimization, Statistics,* and *Economics*. His work further extends to <u>sequential decision making, online learning, online algorithms</u>, and adversarial learning models.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Abernethy specializes in a comprehensive array of research domains, including **Machine Learning**, **Game Theory**, and **Sequential Decision Making**. His expertise encompasses *Online Learning, Optimization, Reinforcement Learning, Algorithmic Game Theory, Econometrics, Financial Engineering,* and *Data Science* within the broader field of **Computer Science**. A significant portion of his research delves into the theoretical foundations of these areas, aiming to develop robust and efficient algorithms for complex decision-making problems in dynamic and often adversarial environments.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Abernethy has made significant contributions to understanding the dynamics of **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, proposing a regret minimization framework to analyze their training behavior and shed light on phenomena like mode collapse. His work provides a new perspective on why these complex neural networks behave the way they do, which is critical for their improvement and stability.\n*   He developed an **efficient algorithm for bandit linear optimization**, a challenging problem in online learning where a decision-maker must choose actions sequentially with incomplete information. This algorithm achieved optimal regret bounds, advancing the state-of-the-art in adaptive decision-making under uncertainty.\n*   In a notable application of data science, Dr. Abernethy co-founded **BlueConduit**, a company that utilizes data science and statistical methods to help cities across the nation identify lead pipes in their water systems. This initiative has directly impacted public health by enabling more targeted and efficient replacement of hazardous infrastructure, contributing significantly to environmental justice and community well-being, notably in cities like Flint, Michigan.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Abernethy earned his **Ph.D. in Computer Science** from the *University of California, Berkeley*, in 2011, following a *Master's degree* from the **Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTI-C)** and a *Bachelor's degree* from **MIT**. His early career trajectory included a role as a *Simons postdoctoral fellow* at the *University of Pennsylvania* from 2011 to 2013.\n\nHe then served as an **Assistant Professor** in the *Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science* at the **University of Michigan** from 2013 to 2017. Since 2017, he has been an **Assistant and later Associate Professor** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*, and in 2022, he took on a dual role as a *Researcher* at **Google Research**.

However, one of the main obstacles to the research on video summarization is the user subjectivity---users have various preferences over the summaries. The subjectiveness causes at least two problems. First, no single video summarizer fits all users unless it interacts with and adapts to the individual users. Second, it is very challenging to evaluate the performance of a video summarizer. To tackle the first problem, we explore the recently proposed query-focused video summarization which introduces user preferences in the form of text queries about the video into the summarization process. We propose a memory network parameterized sequential determinantal point process in order to attend the user query onto different video frames and shots. To address the second challenge, we contend that a good evaluation metric for video summarization should focus on the semantic information that humans can perceive rather than the visual features or temporal overlaps. To this end, we collect dense per-video-shot concept annotations, compile a new dataset, and suggest an efficient evaluation method defined upon the concept annotations. We conduct extensive experiments contrasting our video summarizer to existing ones and present detailed analyses about the dataset and the new evaluation method.","Static Analysis, Abstract Interpretation, Probabilistic Programming, Compilers, Machine Learning, Automatic Differentiation, Formal Verification, Deep Learning, Uncertainty Quantification, Video Summarization","## Overview\n\n**Jacob Laurel** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Computer Science** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*, having joined in Spring 2025.

This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and …","Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Image Recognition, Object Detection, Scene Understanding, Geolocation, Generative Models, Data Science","## Overview\n\n**James Hays** is currently a *Professor* in the **School of Interactive Computing** within the *College of Computing* at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**.

For linear programs of the form  with n variables and d constraints, the generic case d = Ω(n) has recently been settled by Cohen, Lee and Song [STOC’19]. Their algorithm can solve linear programs in Õ(nω log(n/δ)) expected time1, where δ is the relative accuracy. This is essentially optimal as all known linear system solvers require up to O(nω) time for solving Ax = b. However, for the case of deterministic solvers, the best upper bound is Vaidya's 30 years old O(n2.5 log(n/δ)) bound [FOCS’89]. In this paper we show that one can also settle the deterministic setting by derandomizing Cohen et al.'s Õ(nω log(n/δ)) time algorithm. This allows for a strict Õ(nω log(n/δ)) time bound, instead of an expected one, and a simplified analysis, reducing the …","Algorithms and Complexity Theory, Combinatorial Optimization, Graph Algorithms, Convex Optimization, Linear Algebra, Dynamic Algorithms, Data Structures, Approximation Algorithms, Theoretical Computer Science, Randomized Algorithms","## Overview\n\n**Dr. Jan van den Brand** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Computer Science** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

Social support is a crucial factor for achieving adaptive self-help life skills. In this paper we describe the results of a formative design exercise with young adults with autism and their caregivers to uncover opportunities for social networks to promote independence and facilitate coordination. We propose the concept of SocialMirror, a device connected to an online social network that allows the young adult to seek advice from a trusted and responsive network of family, friends and professionals. Focus group discussions reveal the potential for SocialMirror to increase motivation to learn everyday life skills among young adults with autism and to foster collaboration among a distributed care network. We present design considerations to leverage a small trusted network that balances quick response with safeguards for privacy and …","Human-Computer Interaction, Assistive Technologies, Autism Spectrum Disorder Research, Social Computing, Virtual Reality in Education and Training, Health Informatics, Data Visualization and Analytics, Human-Robot Interaction, Accessibility and Inclusive Design, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work","## Overview\n\n**Jennifer G.

However, recent studies have found a significant amount of confusion and misunderstanding surrounding AI. To develop effective educational programs in the field of AI, it is vital to examine and understand learners' pre- and misconceptions as well as myths about AI. This study examined a corpus of 591 studies. 25 relevant studies were identified by applying the following eligibility criteria: English-written original empirical research on education and AI and reporting AI conceptions in a formal learning context. The review found studies from six continents, with the majority conducted in Europe and North America. The studies predominantly focus on the school and university levels. Findings reveal a range of preconceptions, misconceptions, and myths about AI, such as: Learners often have limited understanding of AI on a technical level.

To locate faults, developers must identify statements involved in failures and select suspicious statements that might contain faults. This paper presents a new technique that uses visualization to assist with these tasks. The technique uses color to visually map the participation of each program statement in the outcome of the execution of the program with a test suite, consisting of both passed and failed test cases. Based on this visual mapping, a user can inspect the statements in the program, identify statements involved in failures, and locate potentially faulty statements. The paper also describes a prototype tool that implements our technique along with a set of empirical studies that use the tool for evaluation of the technique.

Some have described Stuxnet as the harbinger of a new form of warfare that threatens even the strongest military powers. The influential but largely untested Cyber Revolution thesis holds that the internet gives militarily weaker actors asymmetric advantages, that offense is becoming easier while defense is growing harder, and that the attacker's anonymity undermines deterrence. However, the empirical facts of Stuxnet support an opposite interpretation; cyber capabilities can marginally enhance the power of stronger over weaker actors, the complexity of weaponization makes cyber offense less easy and defense more feasible than generally appreciated, and cyber options are most attractive when deterrence is intact …","International Security, Cybersecurity, Military Strategy, Deterrence Theory, International Relations Theory, Artificial Intelligence in Warfare, Cyber Conflict, Intelligence Studies, Geopolitics, Technological Change in Warfare","## Overview\n\n**Jon R. Lindsay** is currently an *Associate Professor* at the **School of Cybersecurity and Privacy** and the **Sam Nunn School of International Affairs** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*. His primary research focus lies in exploring the <u>profound role of emerging technology in global security</u>. He investigates how advancements in fields like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity reshape international relations and military power. Professor Lindsay is also actively engaged in a new book project titled ""Age of Deception: Intelligence and Cybersecurity in International Relations,"" which reconsiders cybersecurity through the lens of secret statecraft.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Lindsay specializes in a diverse array of research areas at the intersection of technology and global affairs. His key areas of specialization include **international security**, **cybersecurity**, and the evolving nature of **military power**. He delves into topics such as *military strategy*, *deterrence theory*, **International Relations theory**, and the strategic implications of **Artificial Intelligence in Warfare**. Furthermore, his work extensively covers *cyber conflict*, **intelligence studies**, *geopolitics*, and the broader impact of **technological change in warfare**.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Lindsay's research has significantly challenged the prevalent ""Cyber Revolution thesis,"" which often exaggerates the ease of offense in cyberspace. Through his work, he has demonstrated the **limits of cyber warfare** by highlighting the complexities of deception and attribution, thereby providing a more nuanced understanding of how cyber operations actually unfold and how deterrence can be maintained.\n*   He has made substantial contributions to understanding the relationship between **information technology and military power**, arguing against the notion that technological advancements necessarily simplify or make warfare more efficient. This research underscores the persistent challenges of ""information friction"" and the enduring importance of human and organizational factors in military performance in the digital age.\n*   His influential work on **China and cybersecurity** offers a comprehensive, interdisciplinary analysis that moves beyond alarmist narratives. He critically examines China's cyber capabilities and vulnerabilities, providing crucial context on the political, economic, and strategic dimensions of China's role in the global cybersecurity landscape, and identifying both threats and areas of friction in U.S.-China relations.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Lindsay earned his **Ph.D. in Political Science** from the *Massachusetts Institute of Technology* (MIT). Prior to his doctoral studies, he obtained an **M.S. in Computer Science** and a **B.S. in Symbolic Systems** from *Stanford University*. His academic journey is complemented by practical experience, as he honorably served in the **U.S. Navy**, undertaking operational assignments across Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. Before joining Georgia Tech, he was affiliated with the *University of Toronto*. He is a prolific author and co-author of several significant books, including ""Age of Deception: Cybersecurity as Secret Statecraft"" (Cornell, 2025), ""Information Technology and Military Power"" (Cornell, 2020), and ""Elements of Deterrence: Strategy, Technology, and Complexity in Global Politics"" (Oxford, 2024).",3.1220665,4.5374193,"[-0.4584956169128418, 0.11121153831481934,

Our basic theoretical construction supports single-keyword searches and offers asymptotically optimal server index size, fully parallel searching, and minimal leakage. Our implementation effort brought to the fore several factors ignored by earlier coarse-grained theoretical performance analyses, including low-level space utilization, I/O parallelism and goodput. We accordingly introduce several optimizations to our theoretically optimal construction that model the prototype's characteristics designed to overcome these factors. All of our schemes and optimizations are proven secure and the information leaked to the untrusted server is precisely quantified. We evaluate the performance of our prototype using two very large datasets: a synthesized census database with 100 million records and hundreds of keywords per record and a multi-million webpage collection that includes Wikipedia as a subset. Moreover, we report on an implementation that uses the dynamic SSE schemes developed here as the basis for supporting recent SSE advances, including complex search queries (eg, Boolean queries) and richer operational settings (eg, query delegation), in the above terabyte-scale databases.","Applied Cryptography, Symmetric Cryptography, Asymmetric Cryptography, Provable Security, Cryptographic Protocols, Network Security, Data Security and Privacy, Mobile Security, Quantum Cryptography, Security Proofs","## Overview\n\n**Joseph Jaeger** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Cybersecurity and Privacy** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

Batteries are the single greatest threat to this vision of a sustainable Internet of Things. They are expensive, bulky, hazardous, and wear out after a few years (even rechargeables). Replacing and disposing of billions or trillions of dead batteries per year would be expensive and irresponsible. By leaving the batteries behind and surviving off energy harvested from the environment, tiny intermittently powered computers can monitor objects in hard to reach places maintenance free for decades. The intermittent execution, constrained compute and energy resources, and unreliability of these devices creates new challenges for the sensing and embedded systems community. However, the rewards and potential impact across …","Embedded Systems, Pervasive Computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Energy Harvesting Systems, Wearable Computing, Low-Power Computing, Computer Architecture, Sensor Networks, Machine Learning, Human-Computer Interaction","## Overview\n\n**Josiah Hester** is currently an *Associate Professor* in the **Schools of Interactive Computing and Computer Science** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*, where he holds the <u>Catherine M. and James E.

Joy Arulraj,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rp8dOfAAAAAJ&hl=en,rp8dOfAAAAAJ,Georgia Institute of Technology,2879,"Databases, Database Systems, Data Management",https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jarulraj/,"In the last two decades, both researchers and vendors have built advisory tools to assist database administrators (DBAs) in various aspects of system tuning and physical design. Most of this previous work, however, is incomplete because they still require humans to make the final decisions about any changes to the database and are reactionary measures that fix problems after they occur. What is needed for a truly “self-driving” database management system (DBMS) is a new architecture that is designed for autonomous operation. This is different than earlier attempts because all aspects of the system are controlled by an integrated planning component that not only optimizes the system for the current workload, but also predicts future workload trends so that the system can prepare itself accordingly. With this, the DBMS can support all of the previous tuning techniques without requiring a human to determine the right way and proper time to deploy them. It also enables new optimizations that are important for modern high-performance DBMSs, but which are not possible today because the complexity of managing these systems has surpassed the abilities of human experts. This paper presents the architecture of Peloton, the first selfdriving DBMS. Peloton’s autonomic capabilities are now possible due to algorithmic advancements in deep learning, as well as improvements in hardware and adaptive database architectures.","Database Systems, Non-Volatile Memory Systems, Data Management, Query Optimization, Performance Analysis and Tuning, Video Analytics, Concurrency Control, System Debugging and Testing, Index Structures, Machine Learning for Systems","## Overview\n\n**Joy Arulraj** is currently an *Associate Professor* in the **School of Computer Science** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

However, to date, few studies have examined the actual process of designing with families and their children. Without understanding the process, we risk making poor design choices in user-interactive experiences that take into account important family dynamics. The purpose of this investigation is to understand how parent-child relationships in families shape co-design processes and how they are reshaped through co-design. We document the evolutionary process and outcomes that exist in co-design partnerships between researchers and families. We found that parents' engagement patterns shifted more slowly than that of children's from observing and facilitating to design partnering practices. Our analysis suggests the importance of establishing and …","Learning Sciences, Human-Computer Interaction, Educational Technology, Computer Science Education, Artificial Intelligence in Education, Culturally Responsive Pedagogy, Design Research, Accessibility, Human-Robot Interaction, Mixed Methods Research","## Overview\n\n**Judith Odili Uchidiuno** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Interactive Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

They can also improve recognition despite the presence of domain shift or dataset bias: recent adversarial approaches to unsupervised domain adaptation reduce the difference between the training and test domain distributions and thus improve generalization performance. However, while generative adversarial networks (GANs) show compelling visualizations, they are not optimal on discriminative tasks and can be limited to smaller shifts. On the other hand, discriminative approaches can handle larger domain shifts, but impose tied weights on the model and do not exploit a GAN-based loss. In this work, we first outline a novel generalized framework for adversarial adaptation, which subsumes recent state-of-the-art approaches as special cases, and use this generalized view to better relate prior approaches. We then propose a previously unexplored instance of our general framework which combines discriminative modeling, untied weight sharing, and a GAN loss, which we call Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (ADDA). We show that ADDA is more effective yet considerably simpler than competing domain-adversarial methods, and demonstrate the promise of our approach by exceeding state-of-the-art unsupervised adaptation results on standard domain adaptation tasks as well as a difficult cross-modality object classification task.","Domain Adaptation, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Transfer Learning, Representation Learning, Object Detection, Visual Recognition, Self-Supervised Learning, Generative Adversarial Networks","## Overview\n\n**Dr. Judy Hoffman** is currently an *Associate Professor* at <u>Georgia Tech</u>.

Previous methodologies are either based on random sampling (e.g., Cisco's NetFlow), which is inaccurate, or only account for the ""elephants"". Our paper introduces a novel technique for measuring per-flow traffic approximately, for all flows regardless of their sizes, at very high-speed (say, OC192+). The core of this technique is a novel data structure called Space Code Bloom Filter (SCBF). A SCBF is an approximate representation of a multiset; each element in this multiset is a traffic flow and its multiplicity is the number of packets in the flow. SCBF employs a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method to measure the multiplicity of an element in the multiset. Through parameter tuning, SCBF allows for graceful tradeoff between measurement accuracy and computational and storage complexity. SCBF also …","Computer Networking, Data Streaming Algorithms, Network Security, Network Performance Analysis, Distributed Systems, Algorithms and Data Structures, Traffic Engineering, Peer-to-Peer Networks, Network Measurement, Information Theory","## Overview\n\n**Jun (Jim) Xu** is a *Professor* in the **School of Computer Science** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

Prior attempts at measuring leakage of MLMs via membership inference attacks have been inconclusive, implying the potential robustness of MLMs to privacy attacks. In this work, we posit that prior attempts were inconclusive because they based their attack solely on the MLM's model score. We devise a stronger membership inference attack based on likelihood ratio hypothesis testing that involves an additional reference MLM to more accurately quantify the privacy risks of memorization in MLMs. We show that masked language models are extremely susceptible to likelihood ratio membership inference attacks: Our empirical results, on models trained on medical notes, show that our attack improves the AUC of prior membership inference attacks from 0.66 to an alarmingly high 0.90 level, with a significant improvement in the low-error region: at 1% false positive rate, our attack is 51X more powerful than prior work.","Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Computational Linguistics, Information Retrieval, Computer Vision, Digital Humanities, Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning, Speech Processing, Phonetics","## Overview\n\n**Kartik Goyal** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Interactive Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*, where he joined in Fall 2023.

Kai Wang,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=spWVns8AAAAJ&hl=en,spWVns8AAAAJ,Georgia Institute of Technology,485,"AI for social impact, machine learning, optimization, multi-agent systems, online learning",https://guaguakai.github.io/,"Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) is a paradigm for tailoring a predictive model to a downstream optimization task that uses its predictions in order to perform better\textit {on that specific task}. The main technical challenge associated with DFL is that it requires being able to differentiate through the optimization problem, which is difficult due to discontinuous solutions and other challenges. Past work has largely gotten around this this issue by\textit {handcrafting} task-specific surrogates to the original optimization problem that provide informative gradients when differentiated through. However, the need to handcraft surrogates for each new task limits the usability of DFL. In addition, there are often no guarantees about the convexity of the resulting surrogates and, as a result, training a predictive model using them can lead to inferior local optima. In this paper, we do away with surrogates altogether and instead\textit {learn} loss functions that capture task-specific information. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first approach that entirely replaces the optimization component of decision-focused learning with a loss that is automatically learned. Our approach (a) only requires access to a black-box oracle that can solve the optimization problem and is thus\textit {generalizable}, and (b) can be\textit {convex by construction} and so can be easily optimized over. We evaluate our approach on three resource allocation problems from the literature and find that our approach outperforms learning without taking into account task-structure in all three domains, and even hand-crafted surrogates from the literature.","Decision-Focused Learning, Game Theory, Reinforcement Learning, Optimization, Machine Learning, Multi-Agent Systems, Operations Research, Security Games, Online Learning, Applied Mathematics","## Overview\n\n**Kai Wang** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE)** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

Background In a wireless radiotelephone communication system, many users communicate over a wireless channel. The use of code division multiple access (CDMA) modulation tech niques is one of several techniques for facilitating commu nications in which a large number of system users are present. Other multiple access communication system tech niques, such as time division multiple access (TDMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA) are known in the art. However, the spread spectrum modulation technique of CDMA has significant advantages over these modulation techniques for multiple access communication systems. The CDMA technique has many advantages. An exem plary CDMA system is described in US Pat.

The application-level and seemingly legitimate nature of traffic in such attacks renders most existing solutions ineffective, and the sheer amount and distribution of the generated traffic make mitigation extremely costly. This paper proposes a new approach which leverages edge computing infrastructure to accelerate the detection and the arrest of such attacks, limiting their damaging impact. Our preliminary investigation shows promise for up to 10x faster detection that reduces up to 82% of the Internet traffic due to IoT-DDoS.","Edge Computing, Distributed Systems, Network Security, Mobile Computing, Cloud Computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), Satellite Networks, Machine Learning, System Orchestration","## Overview\n\n**Ketan Bhardwaj** is currently a *Research Scientist II* in the **School of Computer Science**, within the **College of Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

In response, we present MacroBase, a data analytics engine that prioritizes end-user attention in high-volume fast data streams. MacroBase enables efficient, accurate, and modular analyses that highlight and aggregate important and unusual behavior, acting as a search engine for fast data. MacroBase is able to deliver order-of-magnitude speedups over alternatives by optimizing the combination of explanation and classification tasks and by leveraging a new reservoir sampler and heavy-hitters sketch specialized for fast data streams. As a result, MacroBase delivers accurate results at speeds of up to 2M events per second per query on a single core. The system has delivered meaningful results in production, including at a telematics company monitoring hundreds of thousands of vehicles.","Data Management, Big Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Database Systems, Data Mining, Information Retrieval, Computer Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction, Signal Processing","## Academic Summary:\n\n## Overview\n\n**Kexin Rong** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Computer Science** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*, where she leads a research lab dedicated to advancing the computational and human efficiency of large-scale data analytics.

In this paper, we begin to explore factors in the home that might be useful for signaling availability to close friends and family. In particular, we use the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) to measure subjects' current activities and self-reported availability to interruption. Based on follow-up interviews, we develop a number of hypotheses that we test through a hierarchical linear regression analysis. Results indicate that individual differences, certain home locations, and leisure activities play an important role in determining patterns of availability. This study has implications for the development of CSCW systems with automatic sensing of activity to deal with interruption and activity recognition both inside and out of the home.","Human-Computer Interaction, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, Educational Technology, Ubiquitous Computing, Software Engineering, Information Systems, Human Communication, Diversity and Inclusion in STEM, Artificial Intelligence (Activity Recognition), Learning Sciences","## Overview\n\n**Dr. Kristine Nagel** is currently an *Academic Professional* in the **School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

Due to the inherent complexity of the problem, approximate model counting, which counts the number of satisfying assignments to within given tolerance and confidence level, was proposed as a practical alternative to exact model counting. Yet, approximate model counting has been studied essentially only theoretically. The only reported implementation of approximate model counting, due to Karp and Luby, worked only for DNF formulas. A few existing tools for CNF formulas are bounding model counters; they can handle realistic problem sizes, but fall short of providing counts within given tolerance and confidence, and, thus, are not approximate model counters.We present here a novel algorithm, as well as a reference implementation, that …","Formal Methods, Artificial Intelligence, Automated Reasoning, Machine Learning, Probabilistic Inference, Algorithm Design and Analysis, Computer Science Theory, Constraint Satisfaction, Verification and Validation, Boolean Satisfiability","## Overview\n\n**Kuldeep S.

KwangHo Park,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CpVsPWEAAAAJ&hl=en,CpVsPWEAAAAJ,Georgia Institute of Technology,635,Astrophysics,https://kwanghopark.wordpress.com/,"We study the effect of radiative feedback on accretion onto intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) using the hydrodynamical code ZEUS-MP with a radiative transfer algorithm. In this paper, the first of a series, we assume accretion from a uniformly dense gas with zero angular momentum and extremely low metallicity. Our one-dimensional (1D) and 2D simulations explore how X-ray and UV radiation emitted near the black hole regulates the gas supply from large scales. Both 1D and 2D simulations show similar accretion rates and periods between peaks in accretion, meaning that the hydro-instabilities that develop in 2D simulations do not affect the mean flow properties. We present a suite of simulations exploring accretion across a large parameter space, including different radiative efficiencies and radiation spectra, black hole masses, density, and temperature, T∞, of the neighboring gas.

In this study we strive to develop a series of new latent semantic models with a deep structure that project queries and documents into a common low-dimensional space where the relevance of a document given a query is readily computed as the distance between them. The proposed deep structured semantic models are discriminatively trained by maximizing the conditional likelihood of the clicked documents given a query using the clickthrough data. To make our models applicable to large-scale Web search applications, we also use a technique called word hashing, which is shown to effectively scale up our semantic models to handle large vocabularies which are common in such tasks. The new models are evaluated on a Web document ranking task using a …","Conversational AI, Spoken Language Understanding, Dialogue Systems, Speech Technology, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Speaker Recognition, Multimodal Interaction, Information Retrieval","## Overview\n\n**Larry Heck** is currently the *Rhesa Screven Farmer, Jr., Advanced Computing Concepts Chair*, a **Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar**, and a Professor at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**. He holds a joint appointment across the _School of Electrical and Computer Engineering_ and the _School of Interactive Computing_, and serves as the Co-Executive Director of the **Machine Learning Center** and Executive Director of the **AI Hub** at Georgia Tech. His primary research at Georgia Tech's AI Virtual Assistant (AVA) Lab focuses on developing <u>next-generation virtual digital assistants</u> and advancing **Conversational AI with Large Language Models (LLMs)**. This includes exploring LLM response generation and enhancing natural language and speech processing to create autonomous digital humans capable of free communication in open, mixed-reality domains.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Heck specializes in a broad array of research areas within artificial intelligence, including **conversational AI**, **dialogue systems**, and <u>multimodal LLMs</u>. His expertise spans **speech technology**, _Spoken Language Understanding_, **Natural Language Processing**, **Machine Learning**, and <u>Deep Learning</u>. Other key areas include _Speaker Recognition_, **Multimodal Interaction**, and **Information Retrieval**. His current work at the AVA Lab delves into human-computer interaction design for virtual assistants, examining single versus multimodal interactions, and situated interactions across screens and mixed reality environments like AR/VR. He also explores task-oriented conversations, open-domain chit-chat, and both explicit and implicit (commonsense) knowledge-driven interactions to build more accurate, trustworthy, and efficient conversational systems.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Heck played a pivotal role as a co-founder of the **Microsoft Cortana Personal Assistant**, a significant contribution that helped shape the landscape of virtual assistants and made conversational AI accessible to millions of users.\n*   He pioneered the development of <u>large-scale deep neural network (DNN) deep learning technology</u> for speech processing during his tenure at SRI International, where his team was the first to successfully apply this technology to a major industrial application, critically advancing the field of speech recognition. This groundbreaking work also led to a win in the 1998 National Institute of Standards and Technology Speaker Recognition evaluation.\n*   At Google, he established and led the **Deep Dialogue** team, focusing on advanced deep learning research for the **Google Assistant**, further pushing the boundaries of conversational AI and enhancing the capabilities of widely-used intelligent agents.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Heck earned his **Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering** from *Texas Tech University* in 1986, followed by his **Master of Science** in 1989 and **Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering** in 1991 from the _Georgia Institute of Technology_, where he studied under Professor James H. McClellan. He dedicated nearly three decades to industry research before returning to Georgia Tech in 2021 as a Professor. His extensive career includes significant leadership roles at prominent technology companies such as **SRI International**, **Nuance Communications**, **Yahoo!**, **Microsoft Research**, **Google Research**, and **Samsung**, where he was CEO of Viv Labs and SVP. A recognized leader in his field, he was inducted as an **IEEE Fellow** in 2016 and a **Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors** in 2024.

The emerging multiplicity of scholarship in computer science (CS) education forwards diverse voices, perspectives, and positionalities, and together, provide a rich set of evidence-based narratives that can transform K-12 policies and practices. The four projects featured in this panel bring together CS education efforts with varying methodologies focused on equity-oriented pedagogies and learning for all youth across the US. This panel will focus not only on sharing the multi-pronged efforts of the featured projects, but also on developing a shared vision among participants and panelists for what equity"" can and should be in the future of both SIGCSE and CS education as we celebrate SIGCSE's 50th anniversary.

One way to minimize threats in such communities is to use community-based reputations to help estimate the trustworthiness of peers. We present PeerTrust - a reputation-based trust supporting framework, which includes a coherent adaptive trust model for quantifying and comparing the trustworthiness of peers based on a transaction-based feedback system, and a decentralized implementation of such a model over a structured P2P network. PeerTrust model has two main features. First, we introduce three basic trust parameters and two adaptive factors in computing trustworthiness of peers, namely, feedback a peer receives from other peers, the total number of transactions a peer performs, the credibility of the feedback sources, transaction context factor, and the community context factor …","Distributed Systems, Database Systems, Cloud Computing, Privacy-Preserving Technologies, Security Engineering, Machine Learning Security, Data Mining, Mobile Computing, Information Systems, Network Security","## Overview\n\n**Dr. Ling Liu** is a distinguished *Professor* in the **School of Computer Science** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*, where she leads the **Distributed Data Intensive Systems Lab (DiSL)**.

These systemic or ""wicked"" problems present challenges for design practice due to their scope, scale, complexity, and political nature. In this paper, we develop a social justice orientation to designing for such challenges. We highlight a breadth of design strategies that target the goals of social justice along six dimensions -- transformation, recognition, reciprocity, enablement, distribution, and accountability -- and elaborate three commitments necessary to developing a social justice oriented design practice -- a commitment to conflict, a commitment to reflexivity, and a commitment to personal ethics and politics. Although there are no easy solutions to systemic social issues, a social justice orientation provides one way to foster an engagement with the thorny political issues that are increasingly …","Human-Computer Interaction, Interaction Design, Social Computing, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, Science and Technology Studies, Digital Sociology, Participatory Design, Design for Social Justice, Information and Communication Technologies for Development, Qualitative Research Methods","## Overview\n\n**Lynn Dombrowski** is currently an *Associate Professor* in the **School of Interactive Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*. As of September 2025, she also serves as the <u>Director of the Computational Media (CM) program</u>, an interdisciplinary Bachelor of Science degree offered jointly by the College of Computing and the School of Literature, Media, and Communication (LMC). Her primary research focuses on using <u>design and empirical methods to address social inequality</u> through computing technologies, specifically intervening in systemic social issues such as hunger and wage violations. She explores themes of power, empowerment, politics, ethics, values, advocacy, and social justice within the context of sociotechnical systems.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Dombrowski specializes in a comprehensive range of research areas, including **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **Interaction Design**, and **Participatory Design**, with a strong emphasis on <u>social justice and social issues</u>. Her work spans **Social Computing**, **Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)**, **Science and Technology Studies**, and **Digital Sociology**. Furthermore, she explores **Design for Social Justice**, **Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D)**, and employs **Qualitative Research Methods** to investigate the limitations and strengths of applying design methods to contemporary societal challenges.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Dombrowski has been instrumental in developing a **social justice-oriented approach to interaction design**, outlining key strategies and commitments for designers to tackle large-scale societal problems. This work provides a framework for creating technologies that promote equity and address systemic injustices across various dimensions, including transformation and recognition.\n*   Her research has significantly contributed to understanding the complexities of **identity transitions in online spaces**, particularly for transgender and gender non-conforming individuals. She investigated how social computing technologies impact disclosure, stress, and the management of digital footprints during major identity changes, offering insights for more supportive system designs.\n*   She has also led impactful studies on **worker-centered design and technologies for marginalized communities**, examining the sociotechnical practices of low-wage workers in combating wage theft and exploring the communication dynamics within online communities, such as a Minecraft community for children with autism, to re-conceptualize sociality in digital contexts.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Dombrowski earned her **Ph.D. in Informatics** from the *University of California, Irvine*, and an **M.S. in Human-Computer Interaction and Design** from *Indiana University*.

The polyhedral shape and effective local pore size within granular material microstructure are computed in this study by means of the Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT), a local maxima search (non-maximum suppression), and a segmentation process. Various synthetic packed particles are simulated and employed as comparative models during the computation of pore size distribution (PSD). Reconstructed un-sheared and sheared Ottawa 20–30 sand samples are used to compute PSD for non-trivial and non-spherical models.","Geotechnical Engineering, Soil Mechanics, Computational Mechanics, Particle Physics, Materials Science, Data Science, Machine Learning, Modeling and Simulation, Civil Engineering, Urban Planning","## Overview\n\n**M.

Essentially, HCI is the study of sociotechnical articulation. More concretely, scholars of HCI recognize articulation work as the labor, often collaborative, infrastructural, or otherwise metanegotiated, required not only to integrate new technologies into existing systems, but also to maintain those consequent sociotechnical formations [10, 11, 12]. The formation of a feminist HCI [6] can be interpreted as a domain of metaarticulation, wherein feminist perspectives and theories are integrated into both the evaluation of HCI impacts on social constructs as well as the generative practice of designing with and through feminist theory.Like feminist HCI, expressed as a methodology [13], a possible formation of “crip HCI” is not meant to dwell solely within the realm of sociotechnical critique. A crip HCI would generatively integrate …","Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Engineering Design, Assistive Technology, Product Design, Rehabilitation Engineering, Inclusive Design, Design Education, Computer Science Education, Biomedical Engineering, Service Learning","## Overview\n\n**Mahender Mandala** is currently a *Research Scientist I* in the **School of Interactive Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

To meet the challenge of timely interpretation of structure, function and meaning of this vast genetic information, a comprehensive approach to automatic genome annotation is critically needed. In collaboration with Georgia Tech, NCBI has developed a new approach to genome annotation that combines alignment based methods with methods of predicting protein-coding and RNA genes and other functional elements directly from sequence. A new gene finding tool, GeneMarkS+, uses the combined evidence of protein and RNA placement by homology as an initial map of annotation to generate and modify ab initio …","Genomics, Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, Gene Prediction, Genome Annotation, Microbial Genomics, Evolutionary Biology, Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics Software Development, Statistical Modeling in Biology","## Overview\n\n**Mark Borodovsky** is currently a *Regents' Professor* in the **Joint Wallace H.

Consequently, computational systems that can reason about narrative can be more effective communicators, entertainers, educators, and trainers. One of the central challenges in computational narrative reasoning is narrative generation, the automated creation of meaningful event sequences. There are many factors--logical and aesthetic--that contribute to the success of a narrative artifact. Central to this success is its understandability. We argue that the following two attributes of narratives are universal:(a) the logical causal progression of plot, and (b) character believability. Character believability is the perception by the audience that the actions performed by characters do not negatively impact the audience's suspension of disbelief. Specifically, characters must be perceived by the audience to be intentional agents. In this article, we explore the use of refinement search as a technique for solving the narrative generation problem--to find a sound and believable sequence of character actions that transforms an initial world state into a world state in which goal propositions hold. We describe a novel refinement search planning algorithm--the Intent-based Partial Order Causal Link (IPOCL) planner--that, in addition to creating causally sound plot progression, reasons about character intentionality by identifying possible character goals that explain their actions and creating plan structures that explain why those characters commit to their goals. We present the results of an empirical evaluation that demonstrates that narrative plans generated by the IPOCL algorithm …","Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Human-Computer Interaction, Natural Language Processing, Game Design and Development, Computational Narrative, Explainable AI, Intelligent Agents, Cognitive Science, Sociotechnical Systems","## Overview\n\n**Mark Riedl** is currently a *Professor* in the **College of Computing**, specifically in the *School of Interactive Computing* at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**.

However, with this capability comes the issue of how to maximize both team efficiency and the desire of human team members to work with these robotic counterparts. To address this concern, we conducted a set of experiments studying the effects of shared decision-making authority in human–robot and human-only teams. We found that an autonomous robot can outperform a human worker in the execution of part or all of the process of task allocation ( for both), and that people preferred to cede their control authority to the robot . We also established that people value human teammates more than robotic teammates; however, providing robots authority over team coordination more strongly improved the perceived value of these agents than giving similar …","Human-Robot Interaction, Multi-Agent Systems, Reinforcement Learning, Explainable AI, Robotics, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Intelligent Systems, Computer Vision, Operations Research","## Overview\n\n**Matthew Gombolay** is an *Associate Professor* of Interactive Computing at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**.

However, these systems may not work in severely disabled users because they may depend on gaze shifting. This study evaluates the hypothesis that overlapping stimuli can evoke changes in SSVEP activity sufficient to control a BCI. This would provide evidence that SSVEP BCIs could be used without shifting gaze. METHODS Subjects viewed a display containing two images that each oscillated at a different frequency. Different conditions used overlapping or non-overlapping images to explore dependence on gaze function. Subjects were asked to direct attention to one or the other of these images during each of 12 one-minute runs. RESULTS Half of the subjects produced differences in SSVEP activity elicited by overlapping stimuli that could support BCI …","Human-Computer Interaction, Human-Robot Interaction, Assistive Technology, Animal-Computer Interaction, Wearable Computing, Neurotechnology, Biomedical Engineering, Applied Machine Learning, Sensor Networks, Biometrics","## Overview\n\n**Dr. Melody Moore Jackson** is an *Associate Professor* in the **College of Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

This research area tackles the important problem that complex machines and algorithms often cannot provide insights into their behavior and thought processes. XAI allows users and parts of the internal system to be more transparent, providing explanations of their decisions in some level of detail. These explanations are important to ensure algorithmic fairness, identify potential bias/problems in the training data, and to ensure that the algorithms perform as expected. However, explanations produced by these systems is neither standardized nor systematically assessed. In an effort to create best practices and identify open challenges, we describe foundational concepts of explainability and show how they can be used to classify existing literature. We discuss why current approaches to explanatory methods especially for deep neural …","Computer Security, Cryptography, Election Security, Privacy-Preserving Technologies, Mobile Security, System Security, Vulnerability Analysis, Applied Cryptography, Network Security, Software Engineering","## Overview\n\n**Michael A.

In this paper, we provide a seven-month retrospective analysis of Mirai’s growth to a peak of 600k infections and a history of its DDoS victims. By combining a variety of measurement perspectives, we analyze how the botnet emerged, what classes of devices were affected, and how Mirai variants evolved and competed for vulnerable hosts. Our measurements serve as a lens into the fragile ecosystem of IoT devices. We argue that Mirai may represent a sea change in the evolutionary development of botnets—the simplicity through which devices were infected and its precipitous growth, demonstrate that novice malicious techniques can compromise enough low-end devices to threaten even some of the best-defended targets. To address this risk, we recommend technical and nontechnical interventions, as well as propose future research directions.","Computer Security and Privacy, Network Security, Systems and Network Measurement, Distributed Systems, Malware Analysis and Defense, Internet Architecture and Protocols, Cloud Computing Security, Usable Security and Privacy, Cryptography and Applied Cryptography, Software Engineering","## Overview\n\n**Michael Donald Bailey** is currently a *Professor* and the <u>Founding Chair</u> of the **School of Cybersecurity and Privacy (SCP)** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

His primary research focuses on developing <u>hardware and software support for program monitoring, debugging, and security</u>, with a general goal of making both hardware and software more <u>reliable and secure</u>. A significant part of his work investigates <u>side-channel emanations and attacks</u>, a critical area of computer security.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Prvulovic specializes in a broad range of research areas, including **Computer Architecture**, **Computer Security**, and **Software Engineering**. His expertise extends to topics such as *Side Channels, Hardware Security, Microarchitecture, Memory Systems, Embedded Systems Security, Information Leakage, Debugging and Testing*. He explores both the malicious exploitation and the <u>beneficial uses of side channels</u>, such as for program monitoring, profiling, and the detection of malware or malicious hardware. Additionally, his architectural interests encompass <u>hardware support for secure execution</u> and enhancements for multi-core performance, including synchronization and transactional execution.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Prvulovic has significantly advanced the understanding of <u>side-channel emanations and attacks</u>, leading to substantial interest from professional societies and securing a **$9.4 million award from DARPA** for continued study. His research revealed how low-power electronic signals inadvertently emitted by devices, even when disconnected from the internet, can be exploited to reveal sensitive information like typed passwords. To quantify these vulnerabilities, he co-developed a metric called ""signal available to attacker"" (SAVAT), which measures the strength of these informational leaks. This work is crucial for designing more secure hardware and software.\n*   He has made important contributions to enhancing <u>memory security and data integrity</u> through novel hardware-software mechanisms. His projects have focused on improving the cost, performance, and security of memory encryption and authentication schemes, and designing secure processors that are compatible with operating systems and perform well. These efforts aim to protect the privacy and integrity of computation against sophisticated physical attacks and unauthorized access to sensitive data in distributed and multi-processor environments.\n*   Dr. Prvulovic's research has also focused on improving <u>system reliability and debugging capabilities</u> through architectural innovations. He has developed architectural support for rollback recovery in shared-memory multiprocessors to enhance availability and resilience against errors, and leveraged thread-level speculation mechanisms to efficiently debug data races in multithreaded code. Furthermore, his work on memory access monitoring and debugging provides programmable and efficient hardware support to detect various memory-related bugs, many of which can lead to security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Prvulovic earned his **Ph.D.** from the *University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign*. He is recognized for his contributions to the computing field as a **Senior Member of both the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)**. His leadership roles include serving as the <u>Chair of the IEEE Technical Committee on Microprogramming and Microarchitecture</u> in 2016 and as a member of the <u>Steering Committee for the ACM/IEEE MICRO conference</u>. His career trajectory at Georgia Tech reflects a sustained commitment to cutting-edge research in computer architecture and security.",3.9360242,2.8581405,"[-0.5881471633911133, 0.12173008918762207,

Current DRAM-based main memory systems are starting to hit the power and cost limit. An alternative memory technology that uses resistance contrast in phase-change materials is being actively investigated in the circuits community. Phase Change Memory (PCM) devices offer more density relative to DRAM, and can help increase main memory capacity of future systems while remaining within the cost and power constraints. In this paper, we analyze a PCM-based hybrid main memory system using an architecture level model of PCM.We explore the trade-offs for a main memory system consisting of PCMstorage coupled with a small DRAM buffer. Such an architecture has the latency benefits of DRAM and the capacity benefits of PCM. Our evaluations for a baseline system of 16-cores with 8GB DRAM show that, on …","Computer Architecture, Memory Systems, Hardware Security, Quantum Computing, Non-Volatile Memory Technologies, Computer Systems Design, Computer Performance Analysis, Cryptography, Machine Learning Security, Parallel and Distributed Systems","## Overview\n\n**Moinuddin Qureshi** is currently a *Professor* in the **School of Computer Science** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

In this paper we study the problem of efficient data delivery in sparse MANETs where network partitions can last for a significant period. Previous approaches rely on the use of either long range communication which leads to rapid draining of nodes' limited batteries, or existing node mobility which results in low data delivery rates and large delays. In this paper, we describe a Message Ferrying (MF) approach to address the problem. MF is a mobility-assisted approach which utilizes a set of special mobile nodes called message ferries (or ferries for short) to provide communication service for nodes in the deployment area. The main idea behind the MF approach is to introduce non-randomness in the movement of nodes and …","Wireless and Mobile Networks, Computer Networks, Network Protocols, Network Virtualization, Distributed Systems, Peer-to-Peer Networks, Multimedia Communication, Network Security, Network Simulation, Cloud Computing","## Overview\n\n**Mostafa Ammar** is currently a *Regents' Professor* and the **Interim Chair** of the **School of Computer Science** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

Tens of millions of people each year suffer from depression and only a fraction receives adequate treatment. We explore the potential to use social media to detect and diagnose major depressive disorder in individuals. We first employ crowdsourcing to compile a set of Twitter users who report being diagnosed with clinical depression, based on a standard psychometric instrument. Through their social media postings over a year preceding the onset of depression, we measure behavioral attributes relating to social engagement, emotion, language and linguistic styles, ego network, and mentions of antidepressant medications. We leverage these behavioral cues, to build a statistical classifier that provides estimates of the risk of depression, before the reported onset. We find that social media contains useful signals for characterizing the onset of depression in individuals, as measured through decrease in social activity, raised negative affect, highly clustered egonetworks, heightened relational and medicinal concerns, and greater expression of religious involvement. We believe our findings and methods may be useful in developing tools for identifying the onset of major depression, for use by healthcare agencies; or on behalf of individuals, enabling those suffering from depression to be more proactive about their mental health.","Computational Social Science, Social Computing, Mental Health Informatics, Digital Psychiatry, Natural Language Processing, Health Informatics, Machine Learning, Data Mining, Social Network Analysis, Human-Computer Interaction","## Overview\n\n**Dr. Munmun De Choudhury** is currently the *J.Z.

Traditional memory consistency ensures that all processes agree on a common order of all operations on memory. Unfortunately, providing these guarantees entails access latencies that prevent scaling to large systems. This paper weakens such guarantees by definingcausal memory, an abstraction that ensures that processes in a system agree on the relative ordering of operations that arecausally related. Because causal memory isweakly consistent, it admits more executions, and hence more concurrency, than either atomic or sequentially consistent memories. This paper provides a formal definition of causal memory and gives an implementation for message-passing systems. In addition, it describes a practical class of programs that, if developed for a strongly consistent memory, run correctly with causal memory.","Distributed Systems, Cybersecurity, Operating Systems, Data Replication, Consistency Models, Access Control, Network Security, Information Visualization, Malware Analysis, Telephony Security","## Overview\n\n**Mustaque Ahamad** is currently a *Professor* in the **School of Computer Science** within the *College of Computing* at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**.

To demonstrate, we built a 5.4-billion-transistor chip with 4096 neurosynaptic cores interconnected via an intrachip network that integrates 1 million programmable spiking neurons and 256 million configurable synapses. Chips can be tiled in two dimensions via an interchip communication interface, seamlessly scaling the architecture to a cortexlike sheet of arbitrary size. The architecture is well suited to many applications that use complex neural networks in real time, for example, multiobject detection and classification. With 400-pixel-by-240-pixel video input at 30 frames per second, the chip consumes 63 milliwatts.","Neuromorphic Engineering, Systems Neuroscience, Machine Learning, VLSI Circuit Design, Asynchronous Circuit Design, Computer Architecture, Robotics, Computer Vision, Computational Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence","## Overview\n\n**Nabil Imam** is currently an *Assistant Professor* at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**, having joined the faculty in January 2022.

Since a brutal gang-rape incident took place in Delhi in December 2012 and received global attention, women's safety has been the focus of much attention India-wide. In April 2016, the Indian government issued a mandate that all mobile phones sold in India 2017 onwards must include a panic button for women's safety. We draw on interview and survey data to examine women's responses to the mandate, also investigating what factors influence their perceptions of safety, positively and negatively. Our findings indicate that women's sense of safety may be deconstructed into a multitude of factors--personal, public, social, technological--that must align for this sense of safety to be preserved. We then discuss the implications these factors have for the …","Human-Computer Interaction, HCI for Development, Global Health Informatics, Feminist HCI, Intersectionality in Computing, Future of Work and Technology, AI for Social Good, Digital Inclusion and Equity, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, Qualitative Research Methods","## Overview\n\n**Naveena Karusala** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Interactive Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*, having joined the faculty in August 2024. Her primary research investigates how to <u>center care work in the design of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies</u> to enable more sustainable futures of work, with a specific focus on the critical domains of healthcare and social services. Dr. Karusala's work often explores **human-centered AI** and *health and wellbeing in underserved communities*, emphasizing the design of more just care infrastructures that recognize the labor, autonomy, and rights of both care workers and care recipients. She also holds the role of *Vice-President for Communications* on the **ACM SIGCHI Executive Committee**, contributing to an informed and connected HCI research community.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Karusala specializes in a diverse array of research areas at the intersection of computing and social justice. Her expertise encompasses **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, *Health informatics*, **Human-Centered AI**, and the *Future of Work*, with a strong emphasis on addressing societal challenges. She critically examines issues through the lenses of **Feminist HCI**, *Intersectionality in Computing*, and **Digital Inclusion and Equity**, particularly in **Global South contexts**. Her methodological approach frequently involves *qualitative research methods* and *participatory design*, allowing for a deeper understanding of complex socio-technical systems and community needs.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Karusala's research has significantly contributed to understanding **women's safety in public spaces**, particularly in contexts like New Delhi, India. Her work, framed through *feminist HCI*, critically examined women's perceptions of safety and the efficacy of technological interventions like panic buttons, highlighting the social and cultural factors influencing their adoption and impact.\n*   She has advanced the application of **HCI for Development (HCI4D)**, particularly in addressing *mental health challenges* and supporting individuals living with HIV in the Global South. Her qualitative studies on chat-based peer support groups for youth in informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya, demonstrated how popular chat applications could be leveraged to provide accessible and crucial health support beyond formal healthcare settings.\n*   A key focus of her recent work is exploring the **contestability of algorithmic decision-making** in public services and the potential role of *large language models* in medical facilitation work. This research aims to empower individuals, especially those in marginalized communities, to challenge AI-driven outcomes and to enhance the agency of care workers in an increasingly datafied care economy.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Karusala earned her **Ph.D. in Computer Science** from the *University of Washington* and holds a **Bachelor's in Computer Science** from the *Georgia Institute of Technology*, marking her return to her alma mater as faculty. Prior to her current appointment, she served as a **postdoctoral fellow** at the *Harvard Center for Research on Computation and Society*, where she continued to explore the intersection of care, labor, and emerging technologies. Her scholarly contributions have been recognized with awards such as a **Best Paper** at *ACM CHI* and a **Diversity and Inclusion Recognition** at *ACM CSCW*, underscoring the impact and quality of her human-centered research.",12.878231,3.6330037,"[-0.3618263006210327, 0.21499407291412354, 0.15476083755493164, -0.09004978835582733, 0.1030835509300232, 0.08920790255069733, 0.36947041749954224,

Neha Kumar,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-ZqZyP0AAAAJ&hl=en,-ZqZyP0AAAAJ,Associate Professor @Georgia Tech,5493,"Human-Computer Interaction, Health",http://www.nehakumar.org/,"We present a qualitative study of mobile communication via WeChat in Southern China, focusing on the rapid proliferation of emoji and stickers and the lessening dependence on text. We use interview and observation data from 30 participants to investigate how rural, small town, and urban Chinese adults creatively and innovatively balance the use of emoji, stickers, and text in their mobile communication practices. We also discuss design implications of our research for the field of HCI, offering ways of leveraging the non-textual communication practices that we uncover, in scenarios where purely text-based communication may not suffice.","Human-Computer Interaction, HCI for Development, Digital Health, Global Health, Feminist HCI, Technology and Society, Mobile Computing, Assistive Technologies, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Cultural Computing","## Overview\n\n**Neha Kumar** is an *Associate Professor* with a joint appointment in the **Sam Nunn School of International Affairs** and the **School of Interactive Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

Her work frequently investigates mental health in the Global South and the implications of AI for social good, especially in frontline health.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Kumar has significantly contributed to understanding how **digital media and mobile technologies** are appropriated in underserved global contexts, such as studying mobile communication patterns on WeChat in China and the use of mobile phones for maternal health in rural India. This research has informed appropriate technology design and deployment strategies for health information dissemination and community empowerment.\n*   Her foundational work in **HCI for Development (HCI4D)** provides critical analyses and frameworks for designing technologies for under-resourced populations, operationalizing concepts like *intersectionality* and *assets-based design*. She advocates for a ""post-growth"" HCI, challenging unsustainable economic growth models and promoting equitable resource distribution for improved quality of life.\n*   In the realm of **digital mental health and artificial intelligence**, Dr. Kumar has critically examined technology-mediated pathways to mental health support, particularly in the Global South. Her recent work explores the experiences with large language model chatbots for mental health support, envisioning a decolonial digital mental health approach that addresses historical injustices and considers the potential harms of AI systems on frontline health workers and marginalized communities.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Kumar earned her **Ph.D. in Information Management Systems**, specializing in *Human-Computer Interaction*, from *UC Berkeley*. She also holds *Master's degrees in Computer Science and Education* from **Stanford University** and a *Bachelor's in Computer Science and Applied Math* from **UC Berkeley**. Her career trajectory includes postdoctoral research positions at the *University of Washington* and *USC's Annenberg School of Communication*. She has been recognized with significant accolades, including the **NSF CAREER award**, the *Lockheed Inspirational Young Faculty Award* (2017), and the *Lockheed Excellence in Teaching Award* (2019) from Georgia Tech. Demonstrating strong leadership in the field, Dr. Kumar currently serves as the **President of ACM SIGCHI** (since 2021) and the **Chair of the ACM SIG Governing Board** (since 2024), and she

However, this challenges teachers to both learn CT and decide how to best integrate CT into their classes. In this position paper, we present PRADA, an acronym for Pattern Recognition, Abstraction, Decomposition, and Algorithms, as a practical and understandable way of introducing the core ideas of CT to non-computing teachers. We piloted the PRADA model in two, separate, week-long professional development workshops designed for in-service middle and high school teachers and found that the PRADA model supported teachers in making connections between CT and their current course material. Initial findings, which emerged from the analysis of teacher-created learning materials, survey responses, and focus group interviews, indicate that the PRADA model supported core …","Computer Science Education, Computational Thinking, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, Programming Education, Educational Technology, Human-Computer Interaction, Curriculum Design, Pedagogy, Data-Driven Education, K-12 Education","## Overview\n\n**Nicholas Lytle** is currently the *Director of Research* for the **Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS)** program at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*, a role he has held since August 2023.

A new computational method based on image analysis and filter techniques is proposed in this paper to overcome this difficulty. In this method, operations are performed on binary images of particles obtained from raster images (collection of pixels) by the process of image segmentation. The boundary of particles captured in 2D images consist of micro, meso and macro scale features on which filter techniques are applied to remove the micro level features for the quantification of particle roughness and to obtain a roughness free boundary. A robust algorithm is then written and implemented in MATLAB to obtain the complete geometry of …","Geotechnical Engineering, Soil Mechanics, Computational Mechanics, Digital Image Processing, Computer Science Education, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Materials Science, Civil Engineering, Data Science","## Overview\n\n**Nimisha Roy** is currently a *Lecturer* in the **School of Computing Instruction (SCI)** within the *College of Computing* at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

These applications adapt to changing context information: physical context, computational context, and user context/tasks. Context information is gathered from a variety of sources that differ in the quality of information they produce and that are often failure prone. The pervasive computing community increasingly understands that developing context-aware applications should be supported by adequate context information modelling and reasoning techniques. These techniques reduce the complexity of context-aware applications and improve their maintainability and evolvability. In this paper we discuss the requirements that context modelling and reasoning techniques should meet, including the modelling of a variety of context information types and their relationships, of high-level context abstractions describing real world situations using context …","Human-Computer Interaction, Machine Learning, Context-Aware Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Behavioral Analytics, Information Security, Ubiquitous Computing, Recommender Systems, Natural Language Processing, Social Network Analysis","## Academic Summary:\n\n## Overview\n\n**Oliver Brdiczka** is currently an *AI and Machine Learning Architect* at **Adobe Inc.**, where he contributes to **Adobe Sensei**, the company's AI and machine learning technology.

To use these services, developers must bundle third-party, binary-only libraries into their applications. In this model, applications and their advertising libraries share permissions. Advertising-supported applications must request multiple privacy-sensitive permissions on behalf of their advertising libraries, and advertising libraries receive access to all of their host applications' other permissions. We conducted a study of the Android Market and found that 49% of Android applications contain at least one advertising library, and these libraries overprivilege 46% of advertising-supported applications. Further, we find that 56% of the applications with advertisements that request location (34% of all applications) do so only because of advertisements. Such pervasive overprivileging is a …","Internet Measurement, Cybersecurity, Network Security, Computer Forensics, Malware Analysis, Online Privacy, Network Censorship, Distributed Systems, Data Mining, Network Protocols","## Overview\n\n**Paul Pearce** is an *Associate Professor* in the **School of Cybersecurity and Privacy** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*, with his promotion to Associate Professor effective in Fall 2025.

In this context, video conferencing platforms have garnered immense popularity as tools for teaching. However, these tools have several limitations compared to real-world encounters, especially in activities involving collaboration and teamwork. A growing number of researchers and educators have turned to avatar-based communication platforms, such as Mozilla Hubs, as alternatives that can complement video conferencing in social and teaching activities. Several previous research efforts have focused on developing tools that implement avatar-based communication systems or have explored creating activities in these 3D virtual spaces, such as poster sessions in scientific conferences or the classroom environment. In this work, we describe our semester-long efforts to develop Mozilla Hubs rooms toward promoting interaction and communication to help students self-form teams in the context of an introductory virtual reality course at the University of Florida. We describe hands-on activities to prepare students to use Mozilla Hubs effectively, including teaching them skills to customize and create avatars. We describe the implementation of three virtual rooms developed based on researchers' observations and students' survey responses. By observing students' behavior and communication patterns in those rooms, we propose a set of guidelines for building virtual rooms that can promote communication, interaction, and teamwork. We discuss the rooms' design, students' attendance, and avatar choices.

A general analysis of different uncertainties and probability characterization with log‐normal distribution of these uncertainties is introduced. Deriving from a deterministic one‐dimensional fluid–structure interaction model, we establish the stochastic model as a coupled hyperbolic system incorporated with parametric uncertainties to describe the blood flow and pressure wave propagation in the arterial network. By applying a stochastic collocation method with sparse grid technique, we study systemically the statistics and sensitivity of the solution with respect to many different uncertainties in a relatively complete arterial network with potential physiological and pathological implications for the first time.

His primary research focuses on developing <u>fast, scalable, and parallel computational methods</u> for integrating data and models under high-dimensional uncertainty. This work is essential for areas such as statistical model learning through Bayesian inference, ensuring reliable system predictions with uncertainty quantification, enabling efficient data acquisition via optimal experimental design, and facilitating robust control and design through stochastic optimization. Dr. Chen's research is driven by challenging problems involving data-driven modeling, learning, and optimization of complex systems, with broad applications in materials science, energy, health, and natural hazard prediction.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Chen specializes in a multidisciplinary array of research areas, including **computational mathematics**, **data science**, and **scientific machine learning**. A core component of his expertise lies in **Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)** and **Bayesian Inference**, where he addresses the inherent challenges of high-dimensional problems, often referred to as the ""curse of dimensionality"". His work further encompasses *Model Order Reduction (MOR)*, *stochastic optimization*, *Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED)*, and *numerical analysis of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)*. He innovates by developing methods such as <u>reduced basis techniques</u>, <u>sparse grid approximations</u>, and <u>advanced neural surrogates</u> like derivative-informed neural operators to enhance computational accuracy and efficiency for complex systems.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Chen has made significant contributions to the field of <u>Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)</u> by developing **reduced basis methods and sparse grid approximations** for elliptic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with random inputs. This work has notably improved the tractability and efficiency of complex simulations, including those in human arterial network hemodynamics.\n*   He has advanced **high-dimensional Bayesian inference** by introducing novel computational techniques such as *Projected Stein Variational Gradient Descent* and *Projected Stein Variational Newton*. These methods ingeniously exploit intrinsic low-dimensional structures within high-dimensional parameter spaces, offering effective solutions to a longstanding challenge in statistical learning.\n*   A key focus of his recent research involves creating **fast and scalable computational frameworks for large-scale Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED)**.

Peter Swire,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8ThYcf8AAAAJ&hl=en,8ThYcf8AAAAJ,"Huang Professor of Law and Ethics, Georgia Institute of Technology",4059,"Privacy, Cybersecurity",Homepage not specified,"The historic European Union Directive on Data Protection will take effect in October 1998. A key provision will prohibit transfer of personal information from Europe to other countries if they lack “adequate” protection of privacy. If enforced as written, the Directive could create enormous obstacles to commerce between Europe and other countries, such as the United States, that do not have comprehensive privacy statutes. In this book, Peter Swire and Robert Litan provide the first detailed analysis of the sector-by-sector effects of the Directive. They examine such topics as the text of the Directive, the tension between privacy laws and modern information technologies, issues affecting a wide range of businesses and other organizations, effects on the financial services sector, and effects on other prominent sectors with large transborder data flows. In light of the many and significant effects of the Directive as written, the book concludes with detailed policy recommendations on how to avoid a coming trade war with Europe. The book will be of interest to the wide range of individuals and organizations affected by the important new European privacy laws. More generally, the privacy clash discussed in the book will prove a major precedent for how electronic commerce and world data flows will be governed in the Internet Age.","Privacy Law, Cybersecurity Law, Data Protection Law, Internet Law, International Law, Law and Economics, Regulatory Compliance, Environmental Law, Antitrust Law, Financial Regulation","## Overview\n\n**Peter Swire** is currently the *J.Z.

This problem becomes especially challenging when the system of interest exhibits shocks or chaotic dynamics. We present a data-driven modeling method that accurately captures shocks and chaotic dynamics by proposing a new architecture, stabilized neural ordinary differential equation (ODE). In our proposed architecture, we learn the right-hand-side (RHS) of an ODE by adding the outputs of two NN together where one learns a linear term and the other a nonlinear term. Specifically, we implement this by training a sparse linear convolutional NN to learn the linear term and a dense fully-connected nonlinear NN to learn the nonlinear term. This contrasts with the standard neural ODE which involves training a single NN for the RHS. We apply this setup to the viscous …","Plasma Physics, Computational Physics, Numerical Analysis, Scientific Computing, Applied Mathematics, High Performance Computing, Machine Learning, Dynamical Systems, Magnetohydrodynamics, Fluid Dynamics","## Overview\n\n**Qi Tang** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE)** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*, a position he commenced in Fall 2024.

Different from existing model-based approaches that guide testing with a static GUI model (i.e., the model does not evolve its abstraction during testing, and is thus often imprecise), our approach dynamically optimizes the model by leveraging the runtime information during testing. This capability of model evolution significantly improves model precision, and thus dramatically enhances the testing effectiveness compared to existing approaches, which our evaluation confirms.We have realized our technique in a practical tool, APE. On 15 large, widely-used apps from the Google Play Store, APE outperforms the state-of-the-art Android GUI testing tools in terms of both testing coverage and the number of detected unique crashes. To further demonstrate APE's effectiveness and usability, we conduct another …","Program Analysis, Compiler Verification and Testing, Static Analysis, Software Testing and Debugging, Type Inference, Program Debloating, Algorithm Design and Analysis, Dataflow Analysis, Pointer Analysis, Formal Methods","## Overview\n\n**Qirun Zhang** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Computer Science** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

Topology optimization is an important form of inverse design, where one optimizes a designed geometry to achieve targeted properties parameterized by the materials at every point in a design region. This optimization is challenging, because it has a very high dimensionality and is usually constrained by partial differential equations (PDEs) and additional inequalities. Here, we propose a new deep learning method---physics-informed neural networks with hard constraints (hPINNs)---for solving topology optimization. hPINN leverages the recent development of PINNs for solving PDEs, and thus does not require a large dataset (generated by numerical PDE solvers) for training. However, all the constraints in PINNs are soft constraints, and hence we impose hard …","Optical Metasurfaces, Inverse Design, Scientific Machine Learning, Large-scale Optimization, Nanophotonics, Numerical Methods for PDEs, Computational Imaging, Meta-optics, Topology Optimization, Physics-Informed Neural Networks","## Overview\n\n**Raphaël Pestourie** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in **Scientific Machine Learning** at the <u>School of Computational Science and Engineering</u>, Georgia Tech, a position he has held since 2023.

Dr. Pestourie's group develops fast approximate Partial Differential Equation (PDE) models and innovative <u>scientific machine learning techniques</u> that seamlessly integrate AI and scientific principles for resource-efficient, large-scale optimization. He is dedicated to creating hybrid models that bridge theory-driven and data-driven approaches, enhancing large-scale optimization, and facilitating the co-design of physical hardware and software in electromagnetism.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Pestourie specializes in a diverse range of interconnected research areas, with a strong emphasis on **Scientific Machine Learning** and **Large-scale Optimization**. His work extensively explores <u>Numerical Methods for PDEs</u> and their application in advanced computational frameworks. A significant portion of his research is dedicated to **Inverse Design** in various optical fields, including *Optical Metasurfaces*, *Nanophotonics*, and *Meta-optics*, alongside **Computational Imaging**. He also deeply engages with <u>Topology Optimization</u> and the development of <u>Physics-Informed Neural Networks</u>, utilizing these tools to tackle complex engineering problems. His expertise further extends to creating hybrid models that combine theoretical understanding with data-driven insights and pioneering end-to-end optimization for electromagnetic design.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Pestourie has made significant contributions to the <u>inverse design of large-area metasurfaces and meta-optics</u>, developing computational frameworks that enable the efficient optimization of devices thousands of wavelengths in diameter. This work has paved the way for creating high-performance optical components for applications such as virtual reality and multi-wavelength imaging, overcoming previous limitations imposed by high dimensionality and computational costs.\n*   He has been instrumental in the advancement of **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** and <u>deep surrogate models</u> for solving complex engineering problems. By integrating hard constraints into PINNs and developing multifidelity deep neural operators, his research has improved the efficiency of learning partial differential equations, reducing the need for extensive high-fidelity data and enhancing the accuracy-cost trade-off in areas like nanoscale heat transport and metasurface design.\n*   His work on <u>end-to-end nanophotonic inverse design</u> has introduced novel methods for computational imaging and sensing, demonstrating the co-optimization of optical hardware and image-processing software. This innovative approach has yielded superior noise sensitivity and compactness for applications such as subwavelength imaging, full polarization reconstruction, and multi-channel imaging from a single monochrome input.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Pestourie earned his **Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics** with a secondary field in <u>Computational Science and Engineering</u> from Harvard University in 2020, where his doctoral thesis focused on ""Assume Your Neighbor is Your Equal: Inverse Design in Nanophotonics"".

We offer postcolonial computing as an analytical orientation to better understand these challenges. This analytic orientation inspires four key shifts in our approach to HCI4D efforts: generative models of culture, development as a historical program, uneven economic relations, and cultural epistemologies. Then, through reconsideration of the practices of engagement, articulation and translation in other contexts, we offer designers and researchers ways of understanding use and design practice to respond to global connectivity and movement.","Human-Computer Interaction, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, Ubiquitous Computing, Information Visualization, Human-Robot Interaction, Domestic Technology, Mobile Computing, Software Engineering, Security and Privacy, Social Computing","## Overview\n\n**Rebecca E.

Warren Chair in Computing* at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**. He previously served as the <u>founding Chair of Georgia Tech's School of Cybersecurity and Privacy</u>, an academic unit launched in September 2020 to address the national skills gap in cybersecurity. His primary research focuses on the intersection of fundamental problems in digital technology and their public impact, encompassing areas such as **computer security**, **software engineering**, **mathematics**, and **higher education reform**.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. DeMillo specializes in a diverse range of research areas, including **cybersecurity**, **software testing**, and the development of robust **algorithms** and **cryptographic protocols**. His work extends into <u>program analysis and debugging</u>, *formal methods and program verification*, and the theoretical foundations of computer science. He also explores **educational technology** and <u>higher education reform</u>, aiming to innovate teaching and learning methodologies. His current research critically examines *election and voting system security*, reflecting his long-standing commitment to the reliability and societal impact of computing systems.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. DeMillo co-developed the field of **program mutation for software testing**, a significant contribution that established a new method for evaluating the adequacy of software tests by introducing small, single errors into a program. This approach has been instrumental in enhancing software quality and reliability.\n*   He is recognized as a co-inventor of **Differential Fault Cryptanalysis**, a pioneering technique that exploits random hardware faults to break cryptographic schemes. His work in this area includes holding a patent on methods for breaking public key cryptosystems, which has profoundly impacted the understanding and verification of cryptosystem security.\n*   In the realm of **higher education**, Dr. DeMillo authored influential books, ""Abelard to Apple: The Fate of American Colleges and Universities"" (2011) and ""Revolution in Higher Education"" (2015), the latter earning the **Best Education Book award** from the American Publishers Association. He also founded and led Georgia Tech's <u>Center for 21st Century Universities</u>, a dedicated ""living laboratory"" for experimenting with fundamental changes in higher education, influencing computer science programs nationally and internationally.\n*   His seminal 1979 paper, ""Social Processes and Proofs of Theorems and Programs,"" has been cited as one of the **50 most influential papers in computer science**, challenging the prevailing views on the role of formal verification in software engineering. More recently, his expertise in **election and voting system security** has been cited in numerous court cases, including a 2019 Federal Court decision that declared paperless voting machines unconstitutional, underscoring the practical impact of his research on societal infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. DeMillo earned his **Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics** from the *University of St. Thomas* in 1969, and his **Ph.D. in Information and Computer Science** from the *Georgia Institute of Technology* in 1972. His extensive career trajectory includes serving as the **first Chief Technology Officer for Hewlett-Packard** and as Vice President of Computing Research for Bell Communications Research, where he oversaw the development of key e-commerce technologies. He also directed the Computer and Computation Research Division for the National Science Foundation and the Software Test and Evaluation Project for the US Department of Defense, where he developed the DoD's policy for testing software-intensive systems.\n\nBefore returning to Georgia Tech in 2002 as the **John P. Imlay Dean of the College of Computing**, he held faculty positions at the University of Wisconsin, Purdue University, and the University of Padua, Italy. As Dean, he significantly elevated the graduate computer science program rankings and launched the ""Threads"" undergraduate education program. He is an elected **ACM Fellow** (2003) and **AAAS Fellow** (2004) for his significant contributions to reliable and secure software, and was awarded the **ANAK Society's Outstanding Faculty Member Award** in 2016.",5.683216,0.90883404,"[-0.7032508850097656, -0.043759092688560486, 0.1962275356054306, -0.30857211351394653, 0.06059538573026657, 0.08975410461425781, 0.3618776202201843,

A system with poor usability can result in long task times, high error counts, large support costs, long training times, and user dissatisfaction. Consequently, usability is of increasing importance in the marketplace. This paper explores the process, skills, and tools required for an organization to produce usable systems. User-centered design is a development process that identifies and ensures that end user needs are met through an iterative cycle of prototyping and evaluation. The paper discusses skills (human factors engineering and multimedia interaction designers) and tools (usability laboratories and design guidelines) that support a user-centered design process. The paper also identifies factors to consider when justifying the expenses associated with developing usable …","Human-Computer Interaction, Usability Engineering, Human Factors Engineering, Cognitive Psychology, System Design, Human Performance Modeling, User Interface Design, Fault Diagnosis, Large-Scale Systems, Design Pedagogy","## Overview\n\n**Richard Henneman** is currently the *Director* of the **Master's Program in Human-Computer Interaction (MS-HCI)** at the Georgia Institute of Technology and a *Professor of the Practice* in the **School of Interactive Computing**.

These interactions are made possible by strategies that enable organisms to accomplish functions that can be analogous to those required in geotechnical engineering systems. Examples include anchorage in soft and weak ground, penetration into hard and stiff subsurface materials and movement in loose sand. Since the biological strategies have been ‘vetted’ by the process of natural selection, and the functions they accomplish are governed by the same physical laws in both the natural and engineered environments, they represent a unique source of principles and design ideas for addressing geotechnical challenges.

Rosa I. Arriaga,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TaR3dq4AAAAJ&hl=en,TaR3dq4AAAAJ,"Associate Professor, Interactive Computing, Georgia Tech",4045,"hci, mHealth, social computing, cognitive science",https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/rosa-arriaga,"We introduce a new type of test, called a Turing Experiment (TE), for evaluating to what extent a given language model, such as GPT models, can simulate different aspects of human behavior. A TE can also reveal consistent distortions in a language model’s simulation of a specific human behavior. Unlike the Turing Test, which involves simulating a single arbitrary individual, a TE requires simulating a representative sample of participants in human subject research. We carry out TEs that attempt to replicate well-established findings from prior studies. We design a methodology for simulating TEs and illustrate its use to compare how well different language models are able to reproduce classic economic, psycholinguistic, and social psychology experiments: Ultimatum Game, Garden Path Sentences, Milgram Shock Experiment, and Wisdom of Crowds. In the first three TEs, the existing findings were replicated using recent models, while the last TE reveals a “hyper-accuracy distortion” present in some language models (including ChatGPT and GPT-4), which could affect downstream applications in education and the arts.","Human-Computer Interaction, Assistive Technology, Autism Spectrum Disorder Research, Developmental Psychology, Mobile Health (mHealth), Social Computing, Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science, Child Development, Educational Technology","## Overview\n\n**Dr. Rosa I.

Key themes in her research involve developing ecological computing systems to support mental health interventions, chronic care management (e.g., diabetes and asthma), and wellness practices like meditation.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Arriaga has made significant contributions to understanding and *simulating human behavior using large language models*, developing a new testing paradigm to evaluate how effectively these models can represent diverse human responses in research scenarios. This work pushes the boundaries of AI's application in cognitive and social science research.\n*   Her extensive work in **mobile health (mHealth)** has led to the creation and deployment of systems that improve the management of chronic conditions such as *asthma in children* and *diabetes*. These interventions enhance patient engagement, symptom awareness, and facilitate better communication between patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers, ultimately improving health outcomes.\n*   A substantial portion of her research focuses on **assistive and social computing technologies for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**, including designing social networks, tools for remote autism diagnosis via home videos, and systems for crowdsourcing daily living advice. These innovations aim to promote independence, provide vital support networks, and bridge gaps in diagnostic and therapeutic services for individuals with ASD and their families.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Arriaga earned her **Ph.D. (2001) and M.A. (1998) in Developmental Psychology** from *Harvard University*, following a **B.A. in Psychology** from *San Diego State University* in 1994. She joined the faculty at *Georgia Tech* in 2006, initially as a Senior Research Scientist, and was appointed **Associate Professor of Interactive Computing** in August 2021. Her career trajectory also includes time as a visiting scientist at *Carnegie Mellon University's Human Computer Interaction Institute* and *Microsoft Research India* during the 2014-2015 academic year. Furthermore, Dr. Arriaga is an accomplished educator, teaching various undergraduate and graduate courses in HCI, Human-Centered Computing, and Cognitive Science, and she instructs a popular Coursera course on User Experience Design that has reached over 61,000 learners.",11.307344,3.5486064,"[-0.25131744146347046, 0.10188206285238266, 0.3007487952709198, -0.16743485629558563,

Today's networks can only forward traffic based on the destination IP prefix, by selecting among routes offered by their immediate neighbors. We believe Software Defined Networking (SDN) could revolutionize wide-area traffic delivery, by offering direct control over packet-processing rules that match on multiple header fields and perform a variety of actions. Internet exchange points (IXPs) are a compelling place to start, given their central role in interconnecting many networks and their growing importance in bringing popular content closer to end users. To realize a Software Defined IXP (an ""SDX""), we must create compelling applications, such as ""application-specific peering""---where two networks peer only for (say) streaming video traffic. We also need new programming abstractions that allow participating networks to create and run these …","Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Security, Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), Mobile Applications, Robotics, Multicast Networking, Peer-to-Peer Systems, Network Protocol Design, Distributed Systems, Data Science","## Overview\n\n**Russell Clark** is currently a *Senior Research Scientist* at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**, holding a joint appointment as faculty in the *School of Computer Science* and within the **Institute for People and Technology (IPaT)**.

To test this claim, we collect and analyze survey data in the immediate aftermath of a ransomware attack against a Düsseldorf hospital (n = 707). We find that exposure to cyber-attacks significantly diminishes public confidence among segments of the population who are exposed to the attack. Cyber-attacks exploit particular qualities of cyberspace that are directly tied to matters of public confidence, causing a precipitous drop in public trust. Second, we identify the psychological mechanism underpinning this effect, with anger and dread intervening in countervailing directions. Feelings of anger triggered by exposure to cyber-attacks amplify public confidence, while the more potent feeling of dread reduces confidence. Our findings verify …","Cyber Conflict Studies, Political Psychology of Terrorism, Public Opinion and Cybersecurity, Experimental Political Science, International Security Studies, Human Rights Law (Digital Rights), Political Communication, Political Sociology, Cybersecurity Policy, Cyberwarfare Theory","## Overview\n\n**Ryan Shandler** is currently an *Assistant Professor of Political Science* at the **Georgia Tech School of Cybersecurity & Privacy**, holding a joint appointment with the *Sam Nunn School of International Affairs*. His primary research focuses on the <u>human dimension of cybersecurity</u>, exploring how ubiquitous cyber threats and emerging technologies influence political behaviors and attitudes. He emphasizes that the gravest threat posed by cyber-attacks often lies in insidious societal risks, such as <u>reduced public trust in government</u> and psychological distress, rather than purely physical destruction.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Shandler specializes in a wide array of research areas at the intersection of technology and international security. These include **Cyber Conflict**, **Political Psychology**, and **Public Opinion**, with a particular emphasis on *Experimental Methods* to investigate phenomena like *Cyber Conflict Studies*, the *Political Psychology of Terrorism*, and *Public Opinion and Cybersecurity*. His work extends to **International Security Studies**, analyzing **Cybersecurity Policy** and **Cyberwarfare Theory**, as well as the implications of **Human Rights Law** concerning digital rights. A significant portion of his research involves understanding the *social, psychological, and legal ramifications of internet deprivation* and the political effects of public exposure to cyber threats.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Shandler has extensively researched the impact of cyber-attacks on public confidence, demonstrating how exposure to such incidents can <u>significantly diminish public trust in government</u> and generate psychological distress comparable to that caused by physical terrorist attacks. This research has also shown that lethal cyber terrorism can trigger strong public support for retaliation.\n*   His work examines public opinion regarding cyber warfare and policy, revealing how insights into the destructive potential of cyber-attacks influence support for using cyber weapons versus conventional military force. He also explores how public perceptions of cyber threats shape support for intrusive cybersecurity policies and how <u>uncertainty following cyberattacks guides public preferences</u> for various responses.\n*   Recently, Dr. Shandler received the **Young Faculty Award from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)** to investigate the societal toll of cyberattacks. This project aims to understand how psychological warfare, rather than traditional military means, might constitute a significant threat to national security, by tracking a controlled population's perceptions of security after exposure to simulated cyberattacks.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Shandler earned his **Ph.D. from the School of Political Sciences** at the *University of Haifa*, following an *M.A. in Peace and Conflict Management* from the same institution. He also holds a **Bachelor of Laws (Honors)** from the *University of Melbourne, Australia*. Prior to joining Georgia Tech, he was a **postdoctoral fellow** at the *University of Oxford*, affiliated with Nuffield College and the Blavatnik School of Government. Dr. Shandler is a recipient of the **Roberta Sigel Early Career Award** from the *International Society of Political Psychology*. He has developed a new graduate course at Georgia Tech focusing on the human dimension of cybersecurity, reflecting his commitment to integrating political, psychological, and technical elements into cybersecurity education.",3.2831323,4.6369047,"[-0.3706793785095215, 0.11742159724235535, 0.3012920916080475, -0.281229704618454, 0.49187785387039185, 0.25565847754478455, 0.43954595923423767,

This paper advances the state-of-the-art analysis of TTL-based cache networks by developing two exact methods with orthogonal generality and computational complexity. The first method generalizes existing results for line networks under renewal requests to the broad class of caching policies whereby evictions are driven by stopping times; in addition to classical policies used in DNS and web caching, our stopping time model captures an emerging new policy implemented in SDN switches and Amazon web services. The second method further generalizes these results to feedforward networks with Markov arrival process (MAP) requests. MAPs are particularly suitable for non-line networks because they are closed not only under superposition and splitting, as known, but also …","Online Algorithms, Combinatorial Optimization, Stochastic Optimization, Mechanism Design, Prophet Inequalities, Matroid Theory, Discrepancy Theory, Game Theory, Machine Learning, Approximation Algorithms","## Overview\n\n**Dr. Sahil Singla** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Computer Science** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

However, a standalone server may not be able to provide enough storage and processing power for large databases. Nowadays, cloud computing and storage solutions have provided users and enterprises with various capabilities to store and process their data in third-party data centers. However, maintenance of the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data requires trustworthy solutions for storage and processing of data with proven zero information leakage. In this paper, we present CloudID, a privacy-preserving cloud-based and cross-enterprise biometric identification solution. It links the confidential information of the users to their biometrics and stores it in an encrypted fashion. Making use of a searchable encryption technique, biometric …","Cyber-Physical Systems Security, Industrial Control Systems Security, Power Grid Security, Smart Grid Security, Intrusion Detection Systems, Embedded Systems Security, Biometric Security, Cloud Security, Network Security, Robotics Security","## Overview\n\n**Saman Zonouz** is currently an *Associate Professor* with joint appointments in the **Schools of Cybersecurity and Privacy (SCP)** and **Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

XOM provides support for encryption/decryption and integrity checking. However, neither XOM nor any other current approach adequately addresses the problem of information leakage via the address bus. This paper shows that without address bus protection, the XOM model is severely crippled. Two realistic attacks are shown and experiments show that 70% of the code might be cracked and sensitive data might be exposed leading to serious security breaches.Although the problem of address bus leakage has been widely acknowledged both in industry and academia, no practical solution has ever been proposed that can provide an adequate security guarantee. The main reason is that the problem is very difficult to solve in practice due to severe performance degradation which …","Compiler Design, Computer Architecture, Parallel Computing, Embedded Systems, Software Security, Performance Optimization, Program Analysis, Systems Software, Machine Learning Applications in Systems, Distributed Systems","## Overview\n\n**Santosh Pande** is currently a *Professor* of Computer Science in the **School of Computer Science**, within the *College of Computing* at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**.

We prove that, under certain conditions, LSI does succeed in capturing the underlying semantics of the corpus and achieves improved retrieval performance. We also propose the technique of random projection as a way of speeding up LSI. We complement our theorems with encouraging experimental results. We also argue that our results may be viewed in a more general framework, as a theoretical basis for the use of spectral methods in a wider class of applications such as collaborative filtering.","Algorithms, Machine Learning, Optimization, High-Dimensional Geometry, Statistical Inference, Computational Complexity, Data Mining, Probabilistic Methods, Computer Vision, Theoretical Computer Science","## Overview\n\n**Santosh S.

This work significantly advanced the ability to extract meaningful information from large databases and has influenced fields such as *spectral methods, data mining, machine learning*, and *deep neural networks*.\n\n*   He developed foundational **algorithms for clustering and matrix approximation**, including methods that provide robust guarantees for partitioning high-dimensional data and efficiently finding low-rank representations of matrices. His research on random projection introduced a simple yet powerful geometric technique for *dimensionality reduction*, enabling faster and more efficient processing of large datasets.\n\n*   His work on **geometric random walks** and <u>logconcave functions</u> has led to efficient algorithms for sampling from complex probability distributions and optimizing convex functions, with demonstrations of rapid mixing properties for methods like the unadjusted Langevin algorithm. These advancements are crucial for *statistical inference* and solving high-dimensional optimization problems.\n\n*   In a recent and impactful collaboration, Dr. Vempala co-authored a landmark study demonstrating that **hallucinations in large language models (LLMs)** are a <u>mathematically unavoidable statistical lower-bound</u>, irrespective of improvements in training data or engineering techniques. This finding provides a fundamental understanding of the inherent limitations in AI reliability and has significant implications for the development and governance of future AI systems.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Vempala earned his **B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering** from the *Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi*, in 1992, followed by his **Ph.D. in Computer Science** from *Carnegie Mellon University* in 1997, where he was advised by **Professor Avrim Blum**.

The neural bases of numerosity processing have been investigated in structural and functional neuroimaging studies of adults and children, and neural markers of its impairment in dyscalculia have been identified. New interventions to strengthen numerosity processing, including adaptive software, promise effective evidence-based education for dyscalculic learners.","Cognitive Science, Cognitive Psychology, Educational Neuroscience, Computational Neuroscience, Mathematical Cognition, Learning Sciences, Developmental Psychology, Neurocomputation, Cognitive Architecture, Neuroscience Education","## Overview\n\n**Sashank Varma** is currently a *Professor* in both the **School of Interactive Computing** and the **School of Psychology** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*. As a cognitive scientist, his primary research utilizes <u>computational modeling and behavioral experiments</u> to elucidate complex forms of human cognition. His work explores the neural underpinnings of cognitive mechanisms and the educational implications of cognitive learning principles. Dr. Varma's recent research also investigates the cognitive alignment between human intelligence and machine learning models, including how large language models (LLMs) process and understand mathematics, language, and concepts.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Varma specializes in a broad spectrum of research areas, including **Cognitive Science**, **Cognitive Psychology**, **Cognitive Architecture**, and **Mathematical Cognition**. His expertise extends to **Computational Thinking**, **Educational Neuroscience**, **Computational Neuroscience**, and the **Learning Sciences**. He is particularly interested in *human intuitions about abstract mathematical concepts* like geometry and topology, as well as human approaches to solving computationally challenging problems. Furthermore, his research delves into <u>language understanding, continual learning in both humans and machines</u>, and problem-solving strategies, often incorporating insights from **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Varma's research has profoundly influenced the understanding of **dyscalculia**, positing that the condition stems from a core deficit in grasping the concept of numerosity. His work, supported by neuroimaging, has identified neural markers for this impairment and laid the groundwork for targeted interventions to address fundamental mathematical learning difficulties.\n*   He significantly contributed to the ""underconnectivity theory of autism,"" which proposes that the disorder results from reduced anatomical and functional connectivity between frontal and posterior brain regions. This conceptualization, supported by computational models of executive functioning tasks, has provided a valuable framework for understanding the neurological basis of autism.\n*   Through the development of computational modeling architectures, such as **4CAPS**, Dr. Varma has advanced the understanding of complex cognition and brain function. These architectures predict human behavioral data like response times and error patterns, and account for the functional organization of cortical systems, offering a unified theoretical approach to human information processing.\n*   His more recent work examines the extent to which cutting-edge **Large Language Models** demonstrate human-like cognitive abilities, such as understanding numerical magnitudes, processing complex sentences, and forming concepts. This research critically assesses the *cognitive plausibility* of AI models and their potential as models for human cognition and development.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Varma earned his **B.S. in Mathematics and Cognitive Science** from *Carnegie Mellon University* and subsequently completed his **Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology** at *Vanderbilt University*. Following his doctoral studies, he pursued a <u>post-doctoral fellowship at Stanford University</u>. Before joining *Georgia Tech* in August 2020, Dr. Varma held the distinguished position of **Huebner Chair in Education and Technology** at the *University of Minnesota*. His career trajectory highlights a consistent focus on interdisciplinary research that bridges the fields of cognitive science, neuroscience, and education, with a recent expansion into the cognitive implications of artificial intelligence.",14.279563,3.9783587,"[-0.21061241626739502, -0.05749569088220596, 0.2668021619319916, -0.043736375868320465, -0.07679380476474762, 0.265600323677063,

Sehoon Ha,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q6F3O0sAAAAJ&hl=en,Q6F3O0sAAAAJ,Georgia Institute of Technology,7837,"robotics, computer graphics, machine learning",http://cc.gatech.edu/~sha9,"Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been successfully applied to a range of challenging sequential decision making and control tasks. However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: high sample complexity and brittleness to hyperparameters. Both of these challenges limit the applicability of such methods to real-world domains. In this paper, we describe Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), our recently introduced off-policy actor-critic algorithm based on the maximum entropy RL framework. In this framework, the actor aims to simultaneously maximize expected return and entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. We extend SAC to incorporate a number of modifications that accelerate training and improve stability with respect to the hyperparameters, including a constrained formulation that automatically tunes the temperature hyperparameter. We systematically evaluate SAC on a range of benchmark tasks, as well as real-world challenging tasks such as locomotion for a quadrupedal robot and robotic manipulation with a dexterous hand. With these improvements, SAC achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods in sample-efficiency and asymptotic performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving similar performance across different random seeds. These results suggest that SAC is a promising candidate for learning in real-world robotics tasks.","Robotics, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, Motion Planning, Control Systems, Human-Robot Interaction, Embodied AI, Simulated Environments, Robotics Design","## Overview\n\n**Sehoon Ha** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Interactive Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*, and also affiliated with the **Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines (IRIM)**.

In this paper we present an e cient algorithm for mining association rules that is fundamentally di erent from known algorithms. Compared to the previous algorithms, our algorithm reduces both CPU and I/O overheads. In our experimental study it was found that for large databases, the CPU overhead was reduced by as much as a factor of seven and I/O was reduced by almost an order of magnitude. Hence this algorithm is especially suitable for very large size databases. The algorithm is also ideally suited for parallelization. We have performed extensive experiments and compared the performance of the algorithm with one of the best existing algorithms.","Database Systems, Data Mining, Schema Integration, Database Design, Data Modeling, Information Systems Security, Temporal Databases, Distributed Databases, Query Processing, Information Retrieval","## Overview\n\n**Shamkant B.

In this paper, I summarize the state of the art of feminism in HCI and propose ways to build on existing successes to more robustly integrate feminism into interaction design research and practice. I explore the productive role of feminism in analogous fields, such as industrial design, architecture, and game design. I introduce examples of feminist interaction design already in the field. Finally, I propose a set of femi-nist interaction design qualities intended to support design and evaluation processes directly as they unfold.","Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Feminist Studies, Design Research, Critical Theory, Sociology of Technology, Gender Studies, Media Studies, Qualitative Research Methods, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Humanistic Studies","## Overview\n\n**Shaowen Bardzell** is currently a *Professor* and <u>Chair</u> of the **School of Interactive Computing** within the College of Computing at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*. She leads a humanistic research agenda within Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), consistently exploring the contributions of feminism, design, and social science to foster technology's role in social change. Her primary research spans interdisciplinary studies in <u>feminist social science epistemology and methods</u>, IT's relationship to emancipation and participation, social justice informatics, and various applications in women's health, sustainability, and design research.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Bardzell specializes in a rich array of research areas including **Feminist HCI**, **Humanistic Computing**, and **Critical Theory** as applied to design. Her work profoundly engages with *Sustainability*, *Women’s Health* (encompassing menstruation, sexuality, and menopause), *Design Research*, and the broader field of *Human-Computer Interaction*. She also focuses on **Sociology of Technology**, *Gender Studies*, *Media Studies*, and utilizes extensive **Qualitative Research Methods** such as ethnography and interviewing. Recent topics in her research further include <u>care ethics</u>, feminist utopian perspectives on IT, posthumanist approaches to sustainable design, and computational agriculture.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Bardzell has been instrumental in establishing and advancing **feminist perspectives within HCI**, developing frameworks and methodologies that advocate for <u>socially just and equitable technology design</u>, ensuring that issues of agency, identity, and social justice are central to interaction design research and practice.\n*   She significantly contributed to clarifying and legitimizing **critical design** as a research-through-design methodology. Her work elucidates how critical design can foreground the ethics of design practice, reveal underlying values, and explore alternative design futures, thereby enriching HCI's engagement with ethical and societal concerns.\n*   Her research has also explored the **complex relationship between technology and human experiences** in diverse contexts, ranging from understanding body appreciation and sexual function in women to examining cultures of ""making"" (like hackerspaces) and the implications of urban informatics for human-animal cohabitation. This work provides deep insights into how technology can support <u>emancipation, participation, and more sustainable ways of living</u>.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Bardzell earned her **Ph.D. in Comparative Literature** from *Indiana University-Bloomington* in 2004, following an M.A. from the same institution in 1994, and a B.A. from Tunghai University in Taiwan in 1991. Her background in comparative literature profoundly shapes her humanistic approach to Human-Computer Interaction.\n\nBefore joining *Georgia Tech* in 2023, she held professorships at **Pennsylvania State University** (2020-2023) and *Indiana University* (2008-2020). She also served as **Vice President at Large** (2019-2021) and **Executive Vice President** (2021-2022) on the *ACM SIGCHI Executive Committee*, demonstrating her significant leadership within the HCI community. Her extensive contributions were recognized with the **ACM SIGCHI Societal Impact Award** in 2023 and election to the **ACM SIGCHI Academy** in 2024.",12.809987,3.7614248,"[-0.26823920011520386,

Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) attempts to stop code reuse attacks by making the first part of the prerequisite unsatisfiable. However, research in recent years has shown that this protection is often defeated by commonly existing information leaks, which provides attackers clues about the whereabouts of certain code gadgets. In this paper, we present ASLR-Guard, a novel mechanism that completely prevents the leaks of code pointers, and render other information leaks (e.g., the ones of data pointers) useless in deriving code address. The main idea behind ASLR-Guard is to render leak of data pointer useless in deriving code address by separating code and data, provide a secure storage for …","Computer Security, Mobile Security, Privacy Engineering, Software Security, Systems Security, Network Security, Applied Cryptography, Intrusion Detection and Prevention, Software Engineering, Malware Analysis","## Overview\n\n**Simon Pak Ho Chung** is currently a *Research Scientist* at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**, affiliated with both the *Institute for Data Engineering and Science* and the *School of Cybersecurity and Privacy*.

We introduce the LfD design choices in terms of demonstrator, problem space, policy derivation and performance, and contribute the foundations for a structure in which to categorize LfD research. Specifically, we analyze and categorize the multiple ways in which examples are gathered, ranging from teleoperation to imitation, as well as the various techniques for policy derivation, including matching functions, dynamics models and plans. To conclude we discuss LfD limitations and related promising areas for future research.","Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robot Learning, Learning from Demonstration, Human-Robot Interaction, Reinforcement Learning, Embodied AI, Motion Planning, Computer Vision","## Overview\n\n**Sonia Chernova** is currently an *Associate Professor* in the **School of Interactive Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

Difficulties arise due to both the physical model and the numerical method chosen for its solution. We consider the 5-equation model of Allaire et al. [1] and Massoni et al. [2], the 5-equation model of Kapila et al. [3], and the 6-equation model of Saurel et al. [4] as candidate approaches for spherical bubble dynamics, and both MUSCL and WENO interface-capturing methods are implemented and compared. We demonstrate the inadequacy of the traditional 5-equation model for spherical bubble collapse problems and explain the corresponding advantages of the augmented model of Kapila et al.

Representation learning presents an attractive opportunity to model the dynamic evolution of users and items, where each user/item can be embedded in a Euclidean space and its evolution can be modeled by an embedding trajectory in this space. However, existing dynamic embedding methods generate embeddings only when users take actions and do not explicitly model the future trajectory of the user/item in the embedding space. Here we propose JODIE, a coupled recurrent neural network model that learns the embedding trajectories of users and items. JODIE employs two recurrent neural networks to update the embedding of a user and an item at every interaction. Crucially, JODIE also models the future embedding trajectory of a user/item. To this end, it …","Social Network Analysis, Machine Learning, Data Mining, Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, Computer Vision, Human-Computer Interaction, Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence Safety, Recommender Systems","## Overview\n\n**Srijan Kumar** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE)** within the *College of Computing* at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**.

Over 32,000 genes were predicted, of which 99.8% were placed on reference chromosomes. Nearly 85% of the genome is composed of hundreds of families of transposable elements, dispersed nonuniformly across the genome. These were responsible for the capture and amplification of numerous gene fragments and affect the composition, sizes, and positions of centromeres. We also report on the correlation of methylation-poor regions with Mu transposon insertions and recombination, and copy number variants with insertions and/or deletions, as well as how uneven gene losses between duplicated regions were involved in returning an ancient allotetraploid to a genetically diploid state. These analyses inform and set the stage for further investigations to improve …","Computational Genomics, Bioinformatics, Algorithm Design and Analysis, High-Performance Computing, Data Science, Machine Learning, Systems Biology, Evolutionary Biology, Plant Biology, Data Mining","## Overview\n\n**Srinivas Aluru** is a *Regents' Professor* and **Senior Associate Dean** in the **College of Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

State-of-the-art models today do not typically support the manipulation of concepts like"" the existence of bone spurs"", as they are trained end-to-end to go directly from raw input (eg, pixels) to output (eg, arthritis severity). We revisit the classic idea of first predicting concepts that are provided at training time, and then using these concepts to predict the label. By construction, we can intervene on these concept bottleneck models by editing their predicted concept values and propagating these changes to the final prediction. On x-ray grading and bird identification, concept bottleneck models achieve competitive accuracy with standard end-to-end models, while enabling interpretation in terms of high-level clinical concepts ("" bone spurs"") or bird attributes ("" wing color""). These models also allow for richer human-model interaction: accuracy improves significantly if we can correct model mistakes on concepts at test time.","Active Learning, Machine Learning, Experiment Design, Data Curation, Dataset Benchmarking, Model Evaluation, Probabilistic Graphical Models, Latent Variable Models, Network Analysis, Computational Linguistics","## Overview\n\n**Stephen Mussmann** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Computer Science** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*, having joined in Fall 2024. His primary research focuses on the <u>data-centric aspects of machine learning (ML) systems</u>, including methods for data collection, selection, and evaluation to enhance their reliability and usability. He is motivated by the goal of addressing critical bottlenecks in the broad adoption and deployment of ML, working to make these systems easier to build, monitor, and improve.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Mussmann specializes in a diverse range of research areas within machine learning, with a strong emphasis on **data-centric approaches**. His key areas of specialization include _active learning_, which involves strategically selecting data points for supervision, and _experiment design_ for efficient data collection. He also explores various facets of _data curation_, _dataset benchmarking_, and _model evaluation_ to improve the robustness and performance of ML systems. Furthermore, his research extends to understanding _statistical aspects of data algorithms_, such as noise and domain shifts, and working with _probabilistic graphical models_ and _latent variable models_.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Mussmann has contributed to the development of models that facilitate interaction with **high-level concepts**, allowing users to manipulate abstract notions within a model's predictions. This work enables a deeper understanding and querying of how models arrive at their conclusions, moving beyond direct input-output mapping.\n*   He played a key role in creating a **testbed for multimodal dataset experiments**, which is instrumental in the design and curation of next-generation multimodal datasets. This initiative addresses a critical gap in the machine learning ecosystem and is foundational for advancements in areas like generative AI and large multimodal models.\n*   His research also includes developing techniques for **efficient data selection in deep learning**, which significantly reduces the computational expense of training powerful models. By introducing methods that use smaller proxy models for data selection, his work makes advanced machine learning more practical and accessible for handling vast datasets.\n*   More recently, he has developed a framework for **label-efficient supervised finetuning of large language models**, which helps mitigate the substantial costs associated with annotating high-quality instruction datasets. This contribution is crucial for improving the zero-shot generalization capabilities of modern LLMs.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Mussmann earned his **Ph.D. in Computer Science** from *Stanford University* in 2021, where he was advised by **Dr. Percy Liang**. Prior to his doctoral studies, he completed his **Bachelor of Science** in *Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science* at *Purdue University* in 2015. Following his Ph.D., he was an **IFDS postdoctoral fellow** at the *University of Washington CSE* from 2021 to 2023, working with **Dr. Kevin Jamieson** and **Dr. Ludwig Schmidt**. Before joining *Georgia Tech* in Fall 2024, he spent a year as a **machine learning researcher** at *Coactive AI*. His career trajectory highlights a consistent focus on _advancing machine learning through data-centric innovations_.",8.764703,1.2269953,"[-0.2550237774848938, 0.020563432946801186,

Suguman Bansal,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bd9Rk1MAAAAJ&hl=en,bd9Rk1MAAAAJ,"Assistant Professor, Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology",378,"Formal methods, Programming languages, Artificial intelligence",https://suguman.github.io/,"We study the problem of learning control policies for complex tasks given by logical specifications. Recent approaches automatically generate a reward function from a given specification and use a suitable reinforcement learning algorithm to learn a policy that maximizes the expected reward. These approaches, however, scale poorly to complex tasks that require high-level planning. In this work, we develop a compositional learning approach, called DIRL, that interleaves high-level planning and reinforcement learning. First, DIRL encodes the specification as an abstract graph; intuitively, vertices and edges of the graph correspond to regions of the state space and simpler sub-tasks, respectively. Our approach then incorporates reinforcement learning to learn neural network policies for each edge (sub-task) within a Dijkstra-style planning algorithm to compute a high-level plan in the graph. An evaluation of the proposed approach on a set of challenging control benchmarks with continuous state and action spaces demonstrates that it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.","Formal methods, Reinforcement learning, Reactive synthesis, Temporal logic, Game theory, Automated verification, Multi-agent systems, Program synthesis, Automata theory, Artificial intelligence","## Overview\n\n**Suguman Bansal** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Computer Science** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*, a position she assumed in January 2023.

The constitutive equations include a new equation for the evolution of slip system deformation resistance which leads to macroscopic strain hardening behavior that is in good accord with experiments performed on OFHC copper. The good predictive capabilities of the constitutive equations and the time-integration procedure for simulating the stress-strain behavior and the evolution of texture under both homogeneous and non-homogeneous deformation conditions are demonstrated by comparing numerical simulations against experimental measurements in simple shear and a simple plane-strain forging …","Materials Science, Mechanical Engineering, Computational Materials Science, Materials Informatics, Data Science, Crystallography, Metallurgy, Additive Manufacturing, Solid Mechanics, Machine Learning","## Overview\n\n**Surya R.

Researchers have demonstrated that SGX is vulnerable to a page-fault-based attack. However, the attack only reveals page-level memory accesses within an enclave.","Trusted Execution Environments, System Security, Operating System Security, Fuzzing, Memory Safety, File Systems, Computer Architecture, Program Analysis, Cloud Security, Intrusion Detection and Prevention","## Overview\n\n**Taesoo Kim** is currently a *Professor* in both the **School of Computer Science** and the **School of Cybersecurity and Privacy** within the *College of Computing* at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**.

Some believe that standards-based curriculum will level the playing field for students and that the implementation of technology standards may facilitate this process. This article documents themes found in research regarding the Digital Divide from the perspective of school technology integration for children in the U.S. school systems: frequency of use, the differences in students’ educational technology experiences, and teacher professional development. Ideas about how the implementation of technology standards will decrease the gap in the Digital Divide are included.","Computer Science Education Research, Intersectionality Studies, Black Feminist Studies, STEM Education Equity, Digital Divide Research, Educational Technology Integration, Race and Gender in Education, Computing Identity Formation, Social Justice in Technology, Pedagogical Content Knowledge","## Overview\n\n**Tamara Pearson** is currently the *Senior Director of Research and Programs* at the **Constellations Center for Equity in Computing**, based in the *College of Computing* at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**.

This has prompted interest in verifying or certifying logically encoded properties of neural networks. Prior work has largely focused on checking existential properties, wherein the goal is to check whether there exists any input that violates a given property of interest. However, neural network training is a stochastic process, and many questions arising in their analysis require probabilistic and quantitative reasoning, i.e., estimating how many inputs satisfy a given property. To this end, our paper proposes a novel and principled framework to quantitative verification of logical properties specified over neural networks. Our framework is the first to provide PAC-style soundness guarantees, in that its quantitative estimates are within a controllable and bounded error from the true count. We instantiate our algorithmic framework by building a prototype tool …","Machine Learning Security, Formal Verification of Machine Learning, Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning, Adversarial Machine Learning, Program Synthesis, Causal Inference in AI, Machine Unlearning, Explainable AI (XAI), Cybersecurity Analytics, Software Engineering","## Overview\n\n**Teodora Baluta** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Cybersecurity and Privacy** within the **College of Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*, having joined in September 2024.

Systems can scavenge power from human activity or derive limited energy from ambient heat, light, radio, or vibrations. Ongoing power management developments enable battery-powered electronics to live longer. Such advances include dynamic optimization of voltage and clock rate, hybrid analog-digital designs, and clever wake-up procedures that keep the electronics mostly inactive. Exploiting renewable energy resources in the device's environment, however, offers a power source limited by the device's physical survival rather than an adjunct energy store. Energy harvesting's true legacy dates to the water wheel and windmill, and credible approaches that scavenge energy from waste heat or vibration have been around for many decades.

Thomas Ploetz,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kM95eWgAAAAJ&hl=en,kM95eWgAAAAJ,Georgia Institute of Technology,13847,"Computational Behavior Analysis, Activity Recognition, Ubiquitous Computing, Health, Machine Learning",http://www.thomasploetz.de/,"Human activity recognition (HAR) in ubiquitous computing is beginning to adopt deep learning to substitute for well-established analysis techniques that rely on hand-crafted feature extraction and classification techniques. From these isolated applications of custom deep architectures it is, however, difficult to gain an overview of their suitability for problems ranging from the recognition of manipulative gestures to the segmentation and identification of physical activities like running or ascending stairs. In this paper we rigorously explore deep, convolutional, and recurrent approaches across three representative datasets that contain movement data captured with wearable sensors. We describe how to train recurrent approaches in this setting, introduce a novel regularisation approach, and illustrate how they outperform the state-of-the-art on a large benchmark dataset. Across thousands of recognition experiments with randomly sampled model configurations we investigate the suitability of each model for different tasks in HAR, explore the impact of hyperparameters using the fANOVA framework, and provide guidelines for the practitioner who wants to apply deep learning in their problem setting.","Human Activity Recognition, Machine Learning, Ubiquitous Computing, Wearable Computing, Health Monitoring, Biomedical Signal Processing, Computational Behavior Analysis, Sensor Data Analysis, Skill Assessment, Animal Behavior Analysis","## Overview\n\n**Thomas Ploetz** is currently a *Professor of Computing* and the *Associate Chair of Graduate Studies* in the **School of Interactive Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

For example, com munication between a personal computer in Boston and a server in Los Angeles may be routed over a ten different (and equally reasonable) paths depending upon how the network is configured and the current traffic loading on each link among the intervening nodes. Routing on the Internet is typically done using a single path selected from among multiple avail able paths with the chosen path determined by various net work administrators. The motivation behind such “ad hoc'routing is to simplify network management, reduce the need to update routing tables at the various nodes, etc., with the overall goal being more efficient network utilization. Rather than selecting a single path for a communication session, Some wired networks utilize multiple paths for a single session.

Prior to our work, PoS protocols either required parties to obtain a trusted ""checkpoint"" block upon joining and, furthermore, to be frequently online or required an accurate estimate of the number of online parties to be hardcoded into the protocol logic. This ability of new parties to ""bootstrap from genesis"" was a hallmark property of the Bitcoin blockchain and was considered an important advantage of PoW-based blockchains over PoS-based blockchains since it facilitates robust operation in a setting with dynamic availability, i.e., the natural setting---without external trusted objects such as checkpoint blocks---where parties come and go arbitrarily, may join at any moment, or remain offline for prolonged periods of time.

He also holds courtesy appointments within Georgia Tech's **School of Computer Science** and the **Computer Science Department** at *Purdue University*. As a pioneer in blockchain and decentralization research, his primary research focuses on foundational aspects of <u>Cryptography</u>, <u>Cryptocurrencies</u>, <u>Blockchain Technologies</u>, <u>Game Theory</u>, <u>Computer Security</u>, and <u>Distributed Computing</u>. Beyond academia, he serves as the *Chief Scientist* of **Sunday Group** and is the lead architect for its flagship **Mobby blockchain**.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Zikas specializes in a diverse array of interconnected research areas, encompassing **Cryptography**, **Cryptocurrencies**, and **Blockchain Technology**, with a significant focus on their theoretical underpinnings and practical applications. His expertise extends to **Game Theory**, particularly its application in cryptographic protocols and rational protocol design, and **Distributed Computing**, including topics such as Distributed Systems and Byzantine Fault Tolerance. He has extensive experience in **Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)**, addressing challenges like fairness, robustness, and identifiable abort in adversarial settings. His current work also explores areas like <u>differential privacy estimators</u> and <u>blockchain security against adversaries with temporary majority control</u>.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Zikas co-developed the foundational principles for the decentralization of the **Cardano blockchain** as a research fellow and area leader for IOG (formerly IOHK). This contribution was crucial for the security and operational stability of a major cryptocurrency.\n*   He played a key role in introducing **Ouroboros Genesis**, a novel Proof-of-Stake protocol that significantly advanced the ability of new participants to securely join or rejoin blockchain networks using only the genesis block. This innovation mitigated previous requirements for trusted checkpoints or accurate estimations of online parties, enhancing the scalability and robustness of decentralized ledgers.\n*   His work includes a **universally composable treatment of the Bitcoin protocol**, which provided a rigorous security analysis that supports the composition of Bitcoin within larger cryptographic systems. This addressed limitations of earlier property-based security proofs, contributing to a more profound understanding and secure integration of Bitcoin.\n*   He also made significant contributions to establishing **fair and robust multi-party computation protocols** by leveraging global transaction ledgers like Bitcoin. This research demonstrated how to achieve stronger security guarantees, such as fairness and output delivery, even in the presence of a dishonest majority of participants, addressing a long-standing challenge in cryptographic protocol design.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Zikas earned his **Ph.D. in Computer Science** from *ETH Zurich's Information Security and Cryptography Group* from 2006 to 2010, where his dissertation focused on generalized corruption models in secure multi-party computation under the supervision of Dr. Ueli Maurer. His extensive academic journey includes roles as an *Assistant Professor* at **Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)**, an *Associate Professor* and *Vice-Director* of the **Blockchain Technology Lab** at the *University of Edinburgh*, and an *Associate Professor* at *Purdue University*, where he founded and directed the **Purdue Blockchain Lab**. He has also served as a *Research Fellow* at the **Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing** at *UC Berkeley* and a *Swiss NSF fellow*. His research is supported by leading government agencies, including the *NSF* and *DoD* in the U.S., and the *Swiss NSF*, alongside substantial grants from industry partners such as **Sunday Group** and the **Algorand Foundation**.

Instead of running code on manually or randomly constructed input, EXE runs it on symbolic input initially allowed to be anything. As checked code runs, EXE tracks the constraints on each symbolic (i.e., input-derived) memory location. If a statement uses a symbolic value, EXE does not run it, but instead adds it as an input-constraint; all other statements run as usual. If code conditionally checks a symbolic expression, EXE forks execution, constraining the expression to be true on the true branch and false on the other. Because EXE reasons about all possible values on a path, it has much more power than a traditional runtime tool: (1) it can force execution down any feasible program path and (2) at dangerous operations (e.g., a pointer dereference), it detects if the current path constraints allow any value …","Automated Theorem Proving, Software Engineering, Formal Methods, Artificial Intelligence, Constraint Satisfaction, Mathematical Logic, Programming Languages, Computer Science Theory, Machine Learning, Cryptography","## Overview\n\n**Vijay Ganesh** is a *Professor of Computer Science* at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**, having joined in 2023.

As a result, future systems are rapidly moving from uniprocessor to multiprocessor configurations, so as to use parallelism instead of frequency scaling as the foundation for increased compute capacity. The dominant emerging multiprocessor structure for the future is a Non-Uniform Cluster Computing (NUCC) system with nodes that are built out of multi-core SMP chips with non-uniform memory hierarchies, and interconnected in horizontally scalable cluster configurations such as blade servers. Unlike previous generations of hardware evolution, this shift will have a major impact on existing software. Current OO language facilities for concurrent and distributed programming are …","Parallel Computing, Compilers, Programming Languages, Program Analysis, Runtime Systems, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Distributed Systems, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence","## Overview\n\n**Vivek Sarkar** is currently the <u>John P.

In our one-round protocol, XOR gates are evaluated “for free”, which results in the corresponding improvement over the best garbled circuit implementations (e.g. Fairplay [19]).We build permutation networks [26] and Universal Circuits (UC) [25] almost exclusively of XOR gates; this results in a factor of up to 4 improvement (in both computation and communication) of their SFE. We also improve integer addition and equality testing by factor of up to 2.We rely on the Random Oracle (RO) assumption. Our constructions are proven secure in the semi-honest model.","Cryptographic Protocols, Secure Multi-Party Computation, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Garbled Circuits, Private Set Intersection, Oblivious Transfer, Database Privacy, Information Security Architecture, Cyber-Physical Systems Security, Applied Cryptography","## Overview\n\n**Vladimir Kolesnikov** is currently a *Professor* and <u>SCP Senior Associate Chair</u>, jointly with the **School of Computer Science** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

Recently, a number of trends have increased the likelihood that the aware home can soon become a reality. We examine a number of challenges from the technical, social, and pragmatic domains that we feel must be overcome before the vision of the smart home, posited by ubiquitous computing research, can become a reality. Our hope in raising these issues is to create a conversation among researchers in the varied disciplines that make up ubiquitous computing. In particular, we hope to raise awareness of the existing literature on the adoption, use, and history of domestic technologies, as well as the use of situated studies, and the benefits that these can bring to bear on the design and evaluation of technologies for the home","Human-Computer Interaction, Ubiquitous Computing, Collaborative Systems, Document Management Systems, Pervasive Computing, Interaction Design, Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Information Systems, Accessibility, Social Computing","## Overview\n\n**Dr. W.

These methods are limited by the quality and quantity of manually                     simplified corpora, which are expensive to build. In this paper, we conduct an                     in-depth adaptation of statistical machine translation to perform text                     simplification, taking advantage of large-scale paraphrases learned from                     bilingual texts and a small amount of manual simplifications with multiple                     references. Our work is the first to design automatic metrics that are effective                     for tuning and evaluating simplification systems, which will facilitate                     iterative development for this task.","Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Text Simplification, Paraphrasing, Named Entity Recognition, Semantic Similarity, Information Extraction, Multilingual NLP, Language Style Analysis, Computational Linguistics","## Overview\n\n**Wei ""Coco"" Xu** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Interactive Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

The key ideas are to use data mining techniques to discover consistent and useful patterns of system features that describe program and user behavior, and use the set of relevant system features to compute (inductively learned) classifiers that can recognize anomalies and known intrusions. Using experiments on the sendmail system call data and the network tcpdump data, we demonstrate that we can construct concise and accurate classifiers to detect anomalies. We provide an overview on two general data mining algorithms that we have implemented: the association rules algorithm and the frequent episodes algorithm. These algorithms can be used to compute the intra-and inter-audit record patterns, which are essential in describing program or user behavior. The discovered patterns can guide the audit …","Computer Security, Network Security, Machine Learning for Security, Intrusion Detection Systems, Malware Analysis, Botnet Detection, Applied Cryptography, Data Mining, Virtualization Security, Anomaly Detection","## Overview\n\n**Dr. Wenke Lee** is a *Regents' Professor* and the **John P.

We propose and study a unified model for planted k-SAT, which captures well-known special cases. An instance is described by a planted assignment σ and a distribution on clauses with k literals. We define its distribution complexity as the largest r for which the distribution is not r-wise independent (1 ≤ r ≤ k for any distribution with a planted assignment). Our main result is an unconditional lower bound, tight up to logarithmic factors, of Ω(nr/2) clauses for statistical algorithms, matching the known upper bound (which, as we show, can be implemented using a statistical algorithm …","Statistical Physics, Theoretical Computer Science, Combinatorics, Machine Learning, Probability Theory, Discrete Mathematics, Graph Theory, Information Theory, Algorithms, High-Dimensional Geometry","## Overview\n\n**Will Perkins** is currently an *Associate Professor* in the **School of Computer Science** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

While some of these devices have roots in the embedded and high-performance computing spaces, managing current and emerging technologies provides a challenge for system administration that are not always foreseen in traditional data center environments. We present an overview of the motivations and design of the initial Rogues Gallery testbed and cover some of the unique challenges that we have seen and foresee with upcoming hardware prototypes for future post-Moore research. Specifically, we cover networking, identity management, scheduling of resources, and tools and sensor access aspects of the Rogues Gallery along with techniques we have developed to manage these new platforms. We argue that current tools like the Slurm scheduler can support new …","High-Performance Computing (HPC), Systems Management, Computer Networking, Novel Computing Architectures, Post-Moore Computing, Experimental Testbeds, Computer Architecture, Cloud Computing, HPC Education, Resource Scheduling","## Overview\n\n**William Powell** is a *Research Technologist* in the **Computational Sciences and Engineering (CSE)** division at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

This exposure demands that educators help students develop their personal understandings of these technologies to engage with them responsibly. Designing age-appropriate AI curricula for middle school students calls for collaboration and partnership between computer and learning scientists, as well as middle school teachers. Over a 3-year period, we co-designed and successfully implemented an AI education curriculum across 9 geographically and economically diverse schools, offering it to a total of 1551 students. Drawing from our analyses of the curriculum and teacher and student experiences, we propose an effective format for teaching, assessing, and implementing fundamental AI education for middle school settings in the United States. Our research also highlights the value of …","Educational Technology, Computer Science Education, Artificial Intelligence Education, Human-Computer Interaction, Culturally Responsive Pedagogy, Participatory Design, Design Thinking, Ubiquitous Computing, Maker Education, Societal Impact of Technology","## Overview\n\n**William Gelder** is currently a *Research Associate I* in the **School of Interactive Computing** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

We developed a quantitative statistical method to distinguish true biological variability from the high levels of technical noise in single-cell experiments. Our approach quantifies the statistical significance of observed cell-to-cell variability in expression strength on a gene-by-gene basis. We validate our approach using two independent data sets from Arabidopsis thaliana and Mus musculus.,"Computational Biology, Transcriptional Regulatory Network Inference, Single-cell RNA Sequencing Analysis, Evolutionary Biology, Bioinformatics, Machine Learning in Biology, Systems Biology, Bioinformatics Algorithms, Immunology, Protein Structure and Evolution","## Overview\n\n**Xiuwei Zhang** is currently an *Associate Professor* and J. Z. Liang Early Career Associate Professor in the **School of Computational Science and Engineering** within the *College of Computing* at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**. Her primary research focuses on applying <u>machine learning and optimization skills</u> to develop novel methods and analyze complex data from single-cell RNA-Sequencing and other single-cell level technologies. The overarching goal of her work is to decipher cellular mechanisms that drive processes such as *differentiation, development, and disease progression*.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Zhang specializes in a diverse array of research areas at the intersection of biology and computation, including **computational biology**, **bioinformatics**, and the development of <u>advanced methods for single-cell data analysis</u>. Her expertise extends to **transcriptional regulatory network inference**, *single-cell RNA sequencing analysis*, **evolutionary biology**, and the application of <u>machine learning in biological contexts</u>. She also investigates *systems biology approaches*, **bioinformatics algorithms**, and aspects of **immunology** and *protein structure and evolution*.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Zhang developed a significant **quantitative statistical method** that accurately distinguishes genuine biological variability from high levels of technical noise inherent in single-cell experiments. This advancement provided a robust framework for assessing the statistical significance of observed cell-to-cell variability in gene expression, thereby improving the reliability of single-cell RNA-sequencing data interpretation.\n*   She pioneered the creation of <u>computational simulation platforms</u>, such as SymSim and the more recent scMultiSim, which explicitly model the multifaceted processes contributing to variations observed in single-cell RNA-sequencing data. These tools are indispensable for **evaluating and validating new computational methods** in single-cell genomics, with scMultiSim expanding to encompass multimodal and spatial data.\n*   Her work includes the development of sophisticated **deep learning frameworks** like scDART, scMoMaT, and scDisInFact, designed to integrate diverse single-cell omics data—even across different modalities and batches. These frameworks simultaneously learn <u>cross-modality relationships</u> and effectively disentangle technical confounders from critical biological variations, leading to more robust analyses in challenging disease studies.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Zhang earned her **Ph.D. in Computer Science** from the *École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)* in Switzerland, where she conducted her doctoral research under the supervision of **Professor Bernard Moret**. Following her Ph.D., she pursued postdoctoral research at the *European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI)* and the *Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute* in Cambridge, UK, within **Dr. Sarah Teichmann's group** from 2012 to 2015. Subsequently, she was a postdoctoral researcher in **Professor Nir Yosef's group** at *UC Berkeley* from 2016 to 2019.\n\nHer distinguished career trajectory includes being a research fellow in the *2016 Simons Institute program on Algorithmic Challenges in Genomics* and receiving support from the *Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)*. Dr. Zhang's contributions have been recognized with prestigious accolades, including an **NIH Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (MIRA)** in 2021 and an **NSF CAREER Award** in 2022. She achieved a significant career milestone in March 2025, receiving <u>tenure and promotion to Associate Professor</u> at Georgia Tech.",6.368842,-1.4262087,"[-0.4658573269844055,

At present, the development of the metaverse is still in the early stage, and there lacks a framework for the visual construction and exploration of the metaverse. In this paper, we propose a framework that summarizes how graphics, interaction, and visualization techniques support the visual construction of the metaverse and user-centric exploration. We introduce three kinds of visual elements that compose the metaverse and the two graphical construction methods in a pipeline. We propose a taxonomy of interaction technologies based on interaction tasks, user actions, feedback and various sensory channels, and a taxonomy of visualization techniques that assist user awareness. Current potential applications and future opportunities are discussed in the context of visual construction and exploration of the metaverse.

Yingyan (Celine) Lin,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dio8IesAAAAJ&hl=en,dio8IesAAAAJ,"Associate Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology",4515,"Efficient AI algorithms, Deep learning accelerators, Green AI",https://eiclab.scs.gatech.edu/,"(Frankle & Carbin, 2019) shows that there exist winning tickets (small but critical subnetworks) for dense, randomly initialized networks, that can be trained alone to achieve comparable accuracies to the latter in a similar number of iterations. However, the identification of these winning tickets still requires the costly train-prune-retrain process, limiting their practical benefits. In this paper, we discover for the first time that the winning tickets can be identified at the very early training stage, which we term as early-bird (EB) tickets, via low-cost training schemes (e.g., early stopping and low-precision training) at large learning rates. Our finding of EB tickets is consistent with recently reported observations that the key connectivity patterns of neural networks emerge early. Furthermore, we propose a mask distance metric that can be used to identify EB tickets with low computational overhead, without needing to know the true winning tickets that emerge after the full training. Finally, we leverage the existence of EB tickets and the proposed mask distance to develop efficient training methods, which are achieved by first identifying EB tickets via low-cost schemes, and then continuing to train merely the EB tickets towards the target accuracy. Experiments based on various deep networks and datasets validate: 1) the existence of EB tickets, and the effectiveness of mask distance in efficiently identifying them; and 2) that the proposed efficient training via EB tickets can achieve up to 4.7x energy savings while maintaining comparable or even better accuracy, demonstrating a promising and easily adopted method for tackling cost-prohibitive deep network training …","Deep Learning Acceleration, Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search, Neural Network Compression, Graph Neural Network Acceleration, Efficient AI Algorithms, Model Quantization and Pruning, Computer Vision Acceleration, Edge AI Hardware, AI Chip Design Automation, Energy-Efficient AI","## Overview\n\n**Yingyan (Celine) Lin** is currently an *Associate Professor* in the **School of Computer Science** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*.

In this work, we develop a computational pipeline, called DTINet, to predict novel drug–target interactions from a constructed heterogeneous network, which integrates diverse drug-related information. DTINet focuses on learning a low-dimensional vector representation of features, which accurately explains the topological properties of individual nodes in the heterogeneous network, and then makes prediction based on these representations via a vector space projection scheme. DTINet achieves substantial performance improvement over other state-of-the-art methods for drug–target interaction prediction. Moreover, we experimentally validate the novel interactions between three drugs and the cyclooxygenase proteins predicted by DTINet, and demonstrate the new …","Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Drug Discovery, Protein Engineering, Genomics, Remote Sensing, Computer Vision, Systems Biology","## Overview\n\n**Yunan Luo** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE)** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*, a position he has held since January 2022.

Our work presents an improved version of the spectral independence approach of Anari et al. (2020) and shows O(nlogn) mixing time on any n-vertex graph of bounded degree when the maximum eigenvalue of an associated influence matrix is bounded. As an application of our results, for the hard-core model on independent sets weighted by a fugacity λ, we establish O(nlogn) mixing time for the Glauber dynamics on any n-vertex graph of constant maximum degree Δ when λ<λc(Δ) where λc(Δ) is the critical point for the uniqueness/non-uniqueness phase transition on the Δ-regular tree. More generally, for any antiferromagnetic 2-spin system we prove O(nlogn) mixing time of the Glauber dynamics on any bounded degree graph in the corresponding tree …","Theoretical Computer Science, Algorithmic Probability, Statistical Physics, Machine Learning Theory, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Discrete Mathematics, Randomized Algorithms, Computational Complexity, Graph Theory, Optimization","## Overview\n\n**Zongchen Chen** is currently an *Assistant Professor* in the **School of Computer Science** at the *Georgia Institute of Technology*. He previously held positions as an assistant professor at the University at Buffalo and as an instructor (postdoc) in the Department of Mathematics at MIT. His primary research interests broadly encompass <u>randomized algorithms, discrete probability, and machine learning</u>. Dr. Chen's current research particularly focuses on **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods**, approximate counting and sampling, and the learning and testing of high-dimensional distributions.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Chen specializes in a diverse array of theoretical computer science and probabilistic methods, including **Randomized Algorithms**, **Discrete Probability**, and **Machine Learning Theory**. His work extensively features the study of *Markov Chain Monte Carlo* (MCMC) methods, **Algorithmic Probability**, and their applications in statistical physics and computational complexity. He also explores areas such as <u>Discrete Mathematics, Graph Theory, and Optimization</u>, demonstrating a strong foundation in the mathematical underpinnings of computing.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Works\n\n*   Dr. Chen's research has led to the establishment of <u>optimal mixing time bounds for the Glauber dynamics</u>, a fundamental single-site update Markov chain. This work significantly advanced the spectral independence approach, improving our understanding of the convergence rates for widely used sampling algorithms.\n*   He has also made crucial contributions to understanding the <u>rapid mixing of Glauber dynamics up to the uniqueness threshold</u> for general antiferromagnetic 2-spin systems. This provides theoretical insights into the computational phase transitions that occur in complex spin systems.\n*   Another key contribution involves demonstrating a <u>novel connection between probabilistic coupling techniques and analytic tools</u> for analyzing the decay of relative entropy in Markov chains. This research provides optimal bounds on the mixing time and modified log-Sobolev constant for a broad class of Markov chains, including Glauber and Swendsen-Wang dynamics.\n\n---\n\n## Academic Background\n\nDr. Chen earned his **Ph.D. in Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimization (ACO)** from the *School of Computer Science* at the **Georgia Institute of Technology** in 2021, where he was advised by **Eric Vigoda**.

While significant progress has been made, the growing complexity of network designs, meta-learning algorithms, and differences in implementation details make a fair comparison difficult. In this paper, we present 1) a consistent comparative analysis of several representative few-shot classification algorithms, with results showing that deeper backbones significantly reduce the performance differences among methods on datasets with limited domain differences, 2) a modified baseline method that surprisingly achieves competitive performance when compared with the state-of-the-art on both the \miniI and the CUB datasets, and 3) a new experimental setting for evaluating the cross-domain generalization ability for few-shot classification algorithms. Our results reveal that reducing intra-class variation is an important factor when the feature backbone is shallow, but not as critical when using deeper backbones. In a realistic cross-domain evaluation setting, we show that a baseline method with a standard fine-tuning practice compares favorably against other state-of-the-art few-shot learning algorithms.","Machine Learning, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Continual Learning, Navigation, Perception, Natural Language Processing","## Overview\n\n**Dr. Zsolt Kira** is currently an *Associate Professor* at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**, specifically within the **School of Interactive Computing** in the *College of Computing*.

Zvi Galil,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tI3m7CMAAAAJ&hl=en,tI3m7CMAAAAJ,"Professor of Computer Science, Georgia Tech",14423,theoretical computer science,https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/zvi-galil,"Recently, Fredman and Tarjan invented a new, especially efficient form of heap (priority queue). Their data structure, theFibonacci heap (or F-heap) supports arbitrary deletion inO(logn) amortized time and other heap operations inO(1) amortized time. In this paper we use F-heaps to obtain fast algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees in undirected and directed graphs. For an undirected graph containingn vertices andm edges, our minimum spanning tree algorithm runs inO(m logβ (m, n)) time, improved fromO(mβ(m, n)) time, whereβ(m, n)=min {i|log(i)n ≦m/n}. Our minimum spanning tree algorithm for directed graphs runs inO(n logn + m) time, improved fromO(n log n +m log log log(m/n+2)n). Both algorithms can be extended to allow a degree constraint at one vertex.","Algorithms and Data Structures, Graph Theory, Computational Complexity, Combinatorial Optimization, Stringology, Theoretical Computer Science, Parallel and Distributed Computing, Cryptography, Design of Experiments, Discrete Mathematics","## Overview\n\n**Zvi Galil** is currently the *Frederick G. Storey Chair in Computing* and an **Executive Advisor to Online Programs** at the Georgia Institute of Technology. After serving as the <u>Dean of the Georgia Tech College of Computing</u> from 2010 to 2019, his primary research continues to focus on the **design and analysis of algorithms**, <u>computational complexity</u>, and **cryptography**. He is also highly recognized for his significant contributions to computer science education, particularly in online learning initiatives.\n\n---\n\n## Research Areas\n\nDr. Galil specializes in a wide array of theoretical computer science disciplines, including **Algorithms and Data Structures**, **Graph Theory**, <u>Computational Complexity</u>, and **Combinatorial Optimization**.

We describe a new planner, Graphplan, that uses this paradigm. Graphplan always returns a shortest possible partial-order plan, or states that no valid plan exists. We provide empirical evidence in favor of this approach, showing that Graphplan outperforms the total-order planner, Prodigy and the partial-order planner, UCPOP, on a variety of interesting natural and artificial planning problems. We also give empirical evidence that the plans produced by Graphplan are quite sensible. Since searches made by this approach are fundamentally different from the searches of other common planning methods, they provide a new perspective on the planning problem.","Theoretical Computer Science, Algorithms and Data Structures, Computational Complexity, Machine Learning Theory, Cryptography, Graph Theory, Programming Languages and Compilers, Human-Computer Interaction, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Education","## Overview\n\n**Dr. Merrick L.

We propose two computational hypergraph models which avoid this crucial deficiency of the graph model. The proposed models reduce the decomposition problem to the well-known hypergraph partitioning problem. The recently proposed successful multilevel framework is exploited to develop a multilevel hypergraph partitioning tool PaToH for the experimental verification of our proposed hypergraph models. Experimental results on a wide range of realistic sparse test matrices confirm the validity of the proposed hypergraph models. In the decomposition of the test matrices, the hypergraph models using PaToH and hMeTiS result in up to 63 percent less communication volume (30 to 38 percent less on the average …","Combinatorial Scientific Computing, High Performance Computing, Parallel Computing, Biomedical Informatics, Graph Algorithms, Machine Learning, Image Analysis, Computational Science, Data Mining, Scientific Visualization","## Overview\n\n**Dr. Ümit V.
